"✅ Trip Verified |  Porter destroyed my luggage, and then did not make it right at all. Three large holes, two wheels ripped off. I then spoke to the rep at the airport who told me to call. The person on the phone said I must use the website. I did that and haven't heard anything. Honestly, I believe it's all a tactic from them. Create as much friction as possible and hope the passenger gives up on their rights.  Disappointing behavior."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Porter is a great option if you want a flight delay. I've never seen an airline get delayed as much as Porter. Go with Air Canada. 50 dollars extra per ticket is better than waiting 2.5 hours for your flight to arrive."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Flight was at 4pm. Loaded the flight, told to unload the flight, given no communication whatsover regarding lodging, another flight, etc. told by the flight attendee to go get your luggage at carousel 48 and see the porter agent at the check-in counter. Went to the flight check-in counter and not one porter associate. People with mobility challenges going to get their luggage and then told the flight is back on after we’ve left security. We then have to go through multiple busy lanes of people to go through security again and are rushed back to the same gate. We are now 7:50pm and, we still have not left the tarmack, again also not given any communication. We then when coming back on the plane are told to refrain from eating peanuts as someone has a severe food allergy yet, they can’t give us anything to drink or eat. The attendant should not have told us to go to Porter check in m, she should have had us sit and wait for more information. I would not recommend. "
"Not Verified |  Best food I've ever had on a plane and I'm a chef! Fantastic service, nice new plane, impeccably clean, pretty comfortable seat and wifi for the whole trip. A screen to watch in flight entertainment would top it off as my phone screen is small but otherwise cannot fault. I flew with Flair Airlines a few days ago and Porter Airlines feels First Class in comparison."
"Not Verified |  I cannot recommend to anyone to fly with Porter. We had one flight with them on October 22, 2023 - a direct flight with no layovers. And somehow they lost our checked bag. They said that they can tell that we checked it in, but it went no further. So the bag is still at Toronto airport and they are doing absolutely nothing to recover it. After multiple check ins and calls regarding the bag, we had to submit a list of all items in there. Now they’re asking for receipts in order to refund us some of what we have lost. Some items are vintage and many years old - there are no receipts. I do not feel any amount of confidence in this airline, especially when it comes to the care of its customers."
"Not Verified |  I wish I could give a raving review for Porter but unfortunately, my experience was far from pleasant. It was like stepping back to the 1960s - and not in a charming, whimsical way. It was as if modern conveniences, such as online check-in, were all but alien concepts to this airline. The ""in-person-only"" check-in policy is nothing short of archaic and cumbersome, with one bizarre exception - only two nationalities have the privilege of checking in online. Not only does this seem like a potential infringement on equality rights, but it also strikes me as potentially legally questionable. Nevertheless, such favoritism does nothing to enhance my own, or any other passenger's experience who does not fall into these specific nationalities. Moreover, the physical check-in counter promptly shuts down 75 minutes before the flight. This outdated policy could easily result in missed flights for unsuspecting customers. Frankly, if the company's approach to something as straightforward as check-in is this outmoded and complex, I dread to think about how they approach more critical matters. Punctuality and safety must not fall victim to such outdated practices. My concern, therefore, is that this could just be the tip of the iceberg. It naturally raises questions about Porter's operations behind the scenes, where we, as passengers, can't see. My advice to prospective passengers is to tread carefully. Understand the policies thoroughly before booking with Porter. There may be more beneath the surface that could negatively impact your trip."
"Not Verified |  
My family member passed away unexpectedly and I was not able to take my flight. I called to cancel and they said sorry but we cannot return your fare. So you are going to keep my money and also charge someone for the seat I won’t be in. So you are making double the money off one seat. People don’t expect for family members to pass unexpectedly there should be some leeway on these types of spots people are put in."
"Not Verified |  Flown with Porter Airlines 3 times. Very friendly staff and great in flight service for food and drinks however they delayed my flight 3 times. I was supposed to leave at 5:15PM and was supposed to be in Ottawa at 7:00PM then i was boarding and then they delayed the flight because the A/C was broken so i wait to 9:30PM and i get to Ottawa by 11:00PM! and i found it was expensive 1000 just to go to Ottawa but overall its good."
"Not Verified |  This airline doesn’t allow you to have an electronic boarding pass unless you purchase a reserve ticket. If you get a basic ticket they force you to go to the counter to pick up your ticket. Once we picked up our ticket they randomly weigh the carry on and if you’re over 9kgs they force you to check your bag and charge you over $50 an make you check the bag. They attendants don’t weigh all the carryon but if they do and you are over the 9 kgs you will have to pay. Horrible experience and inconsistencies. Poor experience not sure if I will use them again or recommend them. Everyone should have access to their boarding passes and if your going to weigh a carryon, do it for all, don’t single out people."
"Not Verified |  Amazing airline. On time. No middle seat. Food choices to purchase are amazing and healthy. Staff are great I will look for Porter to make my next flight reservations"
"Not Verified | Just wanted to say how great this airline was, lots of room nothing was to much trouble. Very friendly staff, used it twice once from Toronto to Halifax and the return. Great on both journeys"
"Not Verified |  Very disappointed with Porter airlines. First time flying with this company. This is a connecting flight from Italy. We arrived in Montreal at 4pm and it is now 7:45 pm and they have delayed our flight 4 times now.. This company including the airport are very unorganized and quite simply put a disaster. Will never fly with Porter again."
"✅ Trip Verified | The flight was short, relatively comfortable but my on-board small bag was taken from all passengers and stored as luggage. I received my bag with a broken handle (the top of telescopic handle that one uses to roll the back instead of carrying it). As directed by their rep, I filed a claim online with a picture as there was no one to talk to me at the airport, and that I never gotten a reply. Re-visited the website to follow up, and I sent an email, but after over a month now, I received no answer, and it looks like I may never receive one."
"✅ Trip Verified | Everything went so smooth with the flight. The crew were fantastic, five star plus the food was great. Haven’t had such good food on a plane and just loved everything Porter did for us."
"✅ Trip Verified | Everything is wonderful!  It's my first flight with free Internet. They serve various snacks, various drinks (red and white wine, types of juices, coffe, tea) free. Crews very polite and kind, the plane clean. Thank you Porter and I hope you keep your advantages. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  This complaint regards to the ground-crew at Pearson airport. My wife needs assistance with a wheel chair. This assistance was requested and acknowledged when tickets were booked. Upon arrival at Toronto airport there was a wheel chair and porter to assist. The porter pushed the chair to the end of the disembark corridor to the departure lounge, stopped in the centre of the entrance and walked away. He never returned and so after waiting 20 minutes or so, I took care of the issue myself, pushing the wheel chair, together with 2 carry on suitcases, etc. As a result , it took approximately 2 hours from the time we landed, to the time I finally reached the rental car location. I understand the company supplying this service is on contract to Porter, but ultimately it is a Porter issue. There would appear to be no supervision, no accountability, thus personnel who do not care about customers. This lack of service is appalling considering it involves aged and disabled customers"
"Not Verified |  Porter is a terrible airline. I was originally excited to try them and had high hopes but I am now extremely disappointed. Flight delayed. They try to make it sound that the late arrival of their aircraft is not their fault. This time the delay is 100 percent their fault. Wifi on board does not work so do not believe their hype about having free wifi. Seats are extremely uncomfortable and leg room is awful. They try to charge you for choosing a seat. Their agents at the check in desks in Toronto Pearson are the slowest I have ever seen and I have traveled to many airports. "
"Not Verified |  Our flight was cancelled due to weather in NJ 30 minutes before we were supposed to take off. The flight we got re booked on is for another day. The Porter staff informed us because it was a circumstance out of their control they could not provide us with housing until our flight. Even when we showed them the notice on Porters website stating that “if a delay is expected overnight we will provide hotel or other reasonable accommodation, including transportation to and from accommodation.” Not only did they just say nothing could be done when this was brought to them they were in fact rude. I will never be flying Porter again. This was a terrible experience."
"Not Verified |  Worst airline I've ever experienced. First they cancelled our flight few hours before the flight time, rebooked us later that night and the only option was not a direct flight. We had to fly to Ottawa and transfer again to Toronto. They also needed us to claim luggage and check in again at Ottawa. But when we arrived at Ottawa, there were no luggage at all at the baggage claim. Two other passengers were also there looking for their bags but no luck. The staff there said ""I have a feeling that your luggage will be in Toronto when you guys get there, because it's not here and it's not in Boston. Now you guys must run to the gate since we are holding the transfer flight for you."" And so we did. But there was no luggage waiting for us in Toronto. We all filed a report there. The next few days we kept calling them asking for status, but no update until the fifth day. But instead of apologizing to us, they blamed us for not getting the luggage at Ottawa, and they do not want to take responsibility at all. As I'm writing this review, we are still communicating with them and they have not been helpful at all! And we still have not gotten our luggage back yet."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Problems happen, but getting on a plane and sitting in for more than 1 hour and after that time you announce canceling the flight for a problem in your washroom is ridiculous. I was supposed to depart Calgary at 13:35 and arrive at 19:25 Toronto time. Great that they rebooked for me and my wife on the next available flight and which was the next day early morning (6:30 am) and they offered no hotel for the night. Their answer was since you booked through a third party, which was Expedia, then they have to reimburse your stay in a hotel, we cannot guarantee reimbursement for any hotel expenses for this night. The only good thing they did, provided us with breakfast vouchers from the Airport. I understand that but it's not fair leaving your customers stranded in the Airport with no clue. I thank Expedia for assisting us in getting a voucher for a 100 CAD to get a sleep at least with dignity."
"Not Verified |  Why is Porter cancelling so many flights out of Thunder Bay?. Mondays morning flight 2630 845 cancelled Sunday at 3pm (flight crew shortage) , rescheduled to 2638 at 730 that evening. Cancelled at 316 pm just before flight time, crew out of position due to maintenance. A promised reschedule shortly never happened - it’s been 2 days. I am out a lot of money and experienced a lot of angst to find another airline to get me to Toronto for an important family event. I always spoke highly and enjoyed many good years of flying Porter with I and my husband VIP members, but this type of treatment is inexcusable. We have two more flights booked for time sensitive events coming up over the next few months and have lost all confidence Porter will be able to fulfill honouring our booked and paid flights. We can only assume that with their aggressive flight expansion out west, they have effectively abandoned efficiently serving their original “bread and butter” route schedules."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall better than Air Canada (Timmins- Toronto). I fly this route frequently using both airlines (Porter & AC- maybe AC more often than Porter). This review does not relate to the quality of service by check-in agents & ground staff in Timmins. -Much cheaper ticket than Air Canada, better service with kinder flight attendants, better selection of snacks & beverages (AC only gives prezels + water). Aircraft has roomier seats with more space to put bags, generally cleaner; new aircraft, In-flight magazine available. Don't fly to Pearson unless you absolutely have to because Toronto City airport has more efficient service options. Efficient luggage handling, faster exit from aircraft & options to collect bags directly after landing right at the gate. There is a free & fast shuttle bus to Union station with wifi, then take UP express onto Pearson. (Unless you have a short connection under 3 hours departing from Pearson or you have checked bags to struggle with, then fly with AC to directly connect at Pearson. Disadvantage: AC has a better frequently flier program; AC has better French services. Both airlines frequently cancel and have poor customer service dealing with missed flights."
"Not Verified |  This is my first time to fly with Porter Airlines, I heard about this airline from a family member. I was a little confused to book my flight with them or choose WestJet or Air Canada but at the end I booked it through Porter and after flying with them I was so relived that I made a best decision for my trip to fly with Porter. Overall experience from the booking online to the customer service agent contact to check in to fly back and forth to my destination was simply awesome. Staff at the airport and inside the plane (Cabin Crew) were totally professionals. Service that they offered I have never received on any other domestic flights. I would love to book my future travels with them without any hesitation. I am a tall guy but the leg room was simply amazing for a person of my height. I wish they continue providing the same services and include more destinations to there routes. Best of luck to the whole team!"
"Not Verified |  It was my first time flying with Porter Airline, so I was a bit worried, especially because the airfare was much less expensive than many other airlines. However, this was one of my best flights ever, and from now on I will use Porter Airline whenever I can."
"Not Verified |  Never again will I be booking a flight using this airline. For context, my family and I are going on vacation to BC to visit Banff. We arrived at the airport at 4am since our flight was at 7.48am. Not until a couple of minutes before the flight did they finally come for the check in. Mind you they had a whole line behind us from the counter to the airport door. A very unprofessional and unpunctual staff. Never again would I even consider booking a ticket from them."
"Not Verified | Do not take this airline if you are worried about getting to your destination on time. First flight delayed causing me to miss connection. Didn't rebook me on a connection until the following day. Couldn't wait that long. Rented a car in Toronto and drove to Montreal. Told me to pound sand on getting a refund for the inconvenience they caused."
"Not Verified |  The most wonderful staff I have ever met. It was the staff that inspired me to write this review. Because it was an ordinary flight, similar to other flights, but we had one trouble, in which case they usually get off the plane, and it doesn’t matter that the problem is not the fault of the passenger. So, all the staff with a great desire to help, solved our problem and we still flew. This is a real concern for passengers, the human factor, which is just on top in this flight! I want to thank each one separately Charito, Murielle, Jeleesa, captain Matthew, captain Jay"
"Not Verified |  Our flight with United to Vancouver from ROC was canceled due to weather and could not be rebooked for 2 days. We had to be in Vancouver to catch a train. After frantic searching for an alternate travel plan we found Porter Airlines. Jumped in the car, drove 2.5 hours to Toronto and arrived in Vancouver only 3 hours later than original schedule. Everyone from check in to flight attendants was wonderful. As was food and drinks. We are returning now and upgraded to premium seats. Enjoying the same fabulous experience with Porter. Thank you!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a person in a wheelchair needing special assistance. Due to the unpredictable weather of the day I chose to fly home flights where a mess. During this time I hasd the best care and would like to acknowledge the men that assisted me on and off the planes via the 'stair climber'. They were amazing and made all the crazy antics of the day bearable. Thank you so very much, you did an excellent job and it is because of you two I would fly porter again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Flight cancelled due to weather conditions. Re-scheduling suggestion didn't work for me, so I cancelled the booking and requested a refund. Horrible customer service, took 30 days for first review. They refused to give me the money, only a credit. But I am a foreigner not planning to use Porter anymore, and don't have friends in Canada to transfer the credit. So the money stays with Porter, who didn't provide the service, that blames the weather, but I am the one who got screwed. Seems a thieves' practice."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I was scheduled to fly from Quebec City to Toronto on Sunday, 11 June at around 4:30 PM. The flight was first delayed by 50 minutes and was later cancelled. No explanation was given for why this occurred. There was no Porter representative at the gate that we could talk to or that could help us figure out our next steps. All we received was an email automatically notifying us that we’ve been booked on a flight at 9:30 AM the next day. They did not even offer a voucher for a hotel, despite the fact that they were forcing us to stay in Quebec City overnight. With no one at the gate to help us, we were all forced to call Porter representatives and were put on hold for at least 30 minutes to figure out if we can be put on an earlier flight that same day. After I finally get through to someone, I was informed that there is indeed another flight on Sunday to Toronto that goes through Montreal via Air Transat. I asked to be rebooked on that flight and the representative did so, but when I went to pick up my boarding pass for the new flight from Air Transat, I was told my name was not even on the flight manifest. After a two-hour back and forth between the two airlines (Porter insisted that I was booked on that Air Transat flight, according to their records, while Air Transat literally showed me the flight manifest that did not have my name on it - of course, by that time that flight to Montreal had already departed), Porter said the earliest flight they could put me on now would be on Tuesday. I demanded that Porter refund me fully for the flight at that point. To their credit, they did issue a refund thanks to an incredibly kind and compassionate employee on their customer service line who stayed with me on the phone for those two hours to help bring me some kind of resolution to this awful situation, and who advocated for me to get a refund despite it being against Porter’s official policy (if they reschedule you on another flight within 48 hours, they don’t issue a refund). After getting a refund, I booked a 5:00 AM flight on Air Canada for the next morning. Thanks to Porter’s incompetence, however, I was forced to pay for a hotel room out of pocket as I couldn’t leave until the next morning, and the Air Canada flight cost me $100 more. All in all, Porter cost me $250 that basically just went down the drain and that I’ll never get back, for absolutely no reason other than their pure incompetence. I basically ended up paying $750 in total for this short one way flight, thanks to Porter’s incompetence. I will never fly Porter Airlines again. All of this could have been remedied if they had a person at the gate from the beginning. That was the absolute bare minimum and they could not even deliver that."
"Not Verified | This was my first and last time flying with Porter. This airline has no business charging to bring a carry on. I can understand when budget airlines like Ryanair do this - you can pay 50 bucks or even less for an hour flight so you know they will charge for every little thing. With a price of 250 bucks round trip from Ottawa to Toronto, I was shocked when I checked in online and they wanted to charge for a carry on bag. The price of the ticket is definitely not good value if it doesn’t even include such a basic thing. For some unfathomable reason, it’s also more expensive to get a carry on rather than check the bag. Never again. Other things I noticed were the flights were delayed more than once in both directions and the staff were not particularly friendly at all. I had a miserable experience with Porter and would never recommend them. I’ll drive or take Air Canada next time I make the trip."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I was on flight PD2363 on June 8th. All around great service from start to finish. Flight attendants were very accommodating and attentive. My first experience with this airline."
"✅ Trip Verified | Our experience with Porter has been amazing so far! The day before our flight, I went into cancel my father's flight as he was not able to join us on the trip anymore, and realized I ended up cancelling the entire reservation with the three flights for us and not just my father's. So the next morning as soon as the call center was open I called to see if they could reinstate our flights. The staff was very kind and accommodating and was able to work this out in time for our 8am flight! I couldn't believe this as most airlines are not very flexible with their cancel and change policies. The inflight experience was also great. I love that there are no middle seats. The staff was very kind and you get free snacks, meals and beer and wine on the flight! I felt so spoiled! This is something that I have rarely received on economy flights. Thank-you Porter! We will be flying with you again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a frequent business traveler and have never experienced such poor customer service as I have with Porter. My flight from Boston to Ottawa was cancelled initially due to weather - this happens and I completely understand. They rebooked me on a flight the following morning so I had to get a hotel for the night. The following morning the flight was cancelled due to their computers (which seem to go down A LOT by the way!). They then rebooked me on a flight that evening that was again cancelled due to fog. Now, all other airlines were flying but Porter could not because they only have turbo props which apparently can't fly in the fog. They rebooked me for the next day (now two days after I was supposed to get in) and after waiting at the gate for any opportunity to get on a flight, I managed to squeeze on after a total of 21 hours of delays. When I submitted a request for compensation, I was told that the number of minutes of delay for circumstances outside their control (999 minutes) was greater than the minutes of delay within their control (578 minutes) and therefore, my request did not qualify for compensation.  They wouldn't even pay for my hotel or meal expenses that I incurred as a result... Customer service was horrendous. "
"Not Verified |  The staff was attentive and caring. Checked in us frequently. I was travelling with an 8 year old and they made us feel extremely cared for.  It was a wonderful experience. I would recommend this airline for sure. Great job."
"✅ Trip Verified | Cabin staff were pleasant. But my 4pm Porter flight back was canceled due to maintenance issues, and I was rebooked on a 6.55pm flight which departed about 10-15 min. late. Then when we arrived, had to again wait about 10-15 min. for gate agent to arrive. I found seats on new Porter planes with two seats per side quite uncomfortable. Used to fly with Porter whenever I visit family in Montreal because of convenience of flying out of city centre airport, but first experience of newly expanded Porter was not positive."
"✅ Trip Verified | I flew from Vancouver to Halifax with a connecting flight in Toronto on April 11, 2023 and then a return flight to Vancouver on April 20th. I had booked my flight through my World Elite rewards card. I had never flown with this Airline before so I was a little concerned about flight delays, cancellation issues but I was pleasantly surprised. My flights arrived early going to Halifax and coming home to Vancouver, despite mild 20-30 minute delays in Toronto. I found there to be more leg room than other airline planes and all rows contained a window and an aisle seat, no middle seats! There was unlimited inflight wifi and phone chargers at every seat. I received a complimentary wine and a choice of a more substantial snack/meal than other airlines offer. Granted, this was a longer haul flight from Vancouver to Toronto and vice versa. My assumption is that based on other reviews I’ve read, their flights may be getting cancelled because there weren’t enough passengers? I’ve talked to many other people who’ve never heard of this airline and I told them my flying experience was the best I’ve ever had with an airline. I will definitely fly with this airline again."
"Not Verified |  First time flying with Porter and what a nightmare. I landed in Ottawa at 1030am, flight was cancelled for 3.20pm and delayed until 9.45 due to mechanical issues. Waited until 9.45pm and was ready to board when that flight was cancelled as well for mechanical issues. They were not going to be able to fly me to my destination for 2 days. Booked with another flight and thank God I'm getting home today."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Porter Airlines has been quick and efficient in rectifying the issues we had. They have reimbursed us for clothing needed purchased when our baggage’s were delayed by 2 days. They have also compensated us for damages to our baggage on our returning flight. Great job Porter Airline for being quick and efficient on rectifying the issues."
"✅ Trip Verified | This airline is a mess! I called days prior to our flight to ask questions about baggage and what was allowed and what wasn’t. I was warned to expect to lose our baggage. We arrived to the airport on the day of, and everything seemed to go smoothly. All the staff on the flight and the flight itself was exceptional! However, when we arrived to our destination, one of our bags were lost. 2 days later it arrived. We were told we would be called, but no one called. They just delivered it to the address we provided at the airport. On our return flight, everything went smoothly at the airport and in the flight, again, all the flight attendants and the flight itself was great, however was delayed slightly . When arriving to our home destination, we picked up out bags and car seat. Noticed slight damage to one of the bags and the car seat for my child. Unfortunately, we didn’t do a thorough check at the airport. Our car was waiting and we were in a hurry as our flight was delayed by 40 minutes. When I went to put the car seat in the car, the car seat was all taken apart. I had to take the time to secure it and put it back together in order to use it. Then when we got home, we noticed the other bag was all ripped at the pocket. I’ve tried getting in contact with them and no one answers the phone. No one seems to know anything about anything literally. It’s been nothing but chaos. Their customer service is atrocious outside of the flight itself."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible experience! Porter lost my checked bag on my ski trip to Whistler, B.C. Inside the checked bag was over 5000$ worth of snowboarding equipment. The airline has remained silent and has offered no reimbursement to date. Central baggage voicemail is often full and essentially impossible to reach. Customer service is a complete joke. Worst experience I have ever had. Would not recommend to anyone. "
"Not Verified |  When I Originally booked my flight I paid all the extra fees to ensure that I could make a change, or even cancel, and receive a full refund. Literally less than 12 hours before my flight was set to depart, They did a full cancelation of the flight and expected to rebook me days later to arrive at my destination. So, I chose the option to cancel my flight and rebook with a different airline. Fast forward to 2 weeks later, I still have not received the payment on my credit card. So I phoned customer service tonight to inquire.... And the man I spoke with was the most condescending person I have interacted with in a very long time. period. He was unbelievably rude, cut me off repeatedly, and was very sarcastic in his answers when I genuinely asked questions about the airline and their performance. Then i find iut this whole time itd because they chose to just credit my account rather than my card, Which was not agreed upon when I first booked the flight. Thankfully they refunded me fully in the end, but the phone call still somehow ended with this man being terribly rude with me for no reason whatsoever. I was calm, polite, and friendly through the whole conversation.I'm not sure what I did so wrong, but I certainly will never make the mistake of booking with Porter again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Mar 3 They cancelled flight PD2286 from Halifax to Toronto due to a ""coming storm in Toronto"" --- But because they did that they also cancelled flight PD2283 from Tor to Hal leaving 5 hours earlier @12.55pm from Toronto with clear skies in both Cities, this was to avoid having the plane stay in Halifax overnight. This cost 80 passengers stranded in Tor about $200 night for hotels, food, cabs etc. I estimate 80people x$200/night=$16,000 and Porter didn't give a cent. And saved the cost of 2 flight by booking us passengers on scheduled flights the next day. The Canada Transportation Agency only requires them to state the circumstances were ""Unavoidable"" to get away with restitution to their Customers - What a sleazy move, They have also cancelled 3 flights in 8 days from Halifax all at 5pm departure"
"✅ Trip Verified | Ridiculously unreliable - 26 hours before my flight I received notice that it had been cancelled and my ticket transferred to a flight leaving 9 hours earlier. I managed to get to the airport in time for that flight, only to have it delayed twice with no explanation. Cheap tickets, terrible service, take your chances and don’t fly Porter if you need to make a connecting flight."
"Not Verified |  They cancelled my outbound and return flights. They only informed of the change in the outbound flight and could only offer a flight that arrived the next day. The return flight I just happen to check to find they changed it to return a day early and could not offer another flight for more than 48 hours. Lack of communication about this was appalling and in the end I had to cancel and pay way more to get last minute flights with another airline. Don't fly with these guys unless you don't care what day you arrive, what day you leave and want to pay extra for accomodations."
"Not Verified |  I had booked 4 tickets for a trip from Toronto to Calgary over 8 weeks ago for this coming March break. Two days before the departure date I receive an email saying flight had been cancelled and they would put us on a flight 4 days later after my departure date. When I called, after waiting close to an hour on hold, this was the only “solution” they could provide. Clearly this was not a solution so I asked to speak to a manager. I was told I would hear back in 24 hr. I am still waiting. For an airline that brands itself so highly, this is highly disappointing in so many ways and breeds the contempt everyone has for airlines - they are no better. To top it off, it will now cost me 3,000 dollars more to fly another airline because of booking it 2 days before departure. They will never get business from me or anyone else that brings up airlines in my presence."
"Not Verified | Booked to fly Calgary to Toronto on March 4th, flight 360. It was cancelled due to bad weather in Toronto. Email confirmation of the cancellation auto booked me to the flight the next morning. Noticing that their was a flight earlier in the day that had been rescheduled for mid afternoon I called them. I was on hold for well over an hour (their recorded message said it would be 15 minutes). Then when an agent answered I requested to be moved to the earlier flight and he took all my information and asked me to hold again. After 15 minutes again on hold they disconnected the call. They have both my email and phone number --do you think they bothered to call back. They have very recently started flying this route and from the looks of it they are not ready to fly with the Big Boys yet. I could have flown cheaper with Air Canada but thought I would try Porter - big mistake. My brother-in-law flew earlier in the week and also got cancelled. Not a good start to flying this new route!"
"Not Verified |  Porter Airlines is quite unreliable, I had my flight cancelled twice and was rebooked for a flight 6 days after the original. However, the customer service was amazing and my flight was brought forward by the amazing Shasha. She worked really hard to find a way to get me to my destination despite booked up flights and was the most efficient, kind and friendly airline customer server I have ever spoken to. Thank you Shasha for brightening up my day and being such a life saver!"
"Not Verified | Worst airline company and customer service ever! Completely not professional. Hated my experience and would not recommend it. So much sub par to the performance of other airlines I experienced. The communication nor the comfort is very amateurish. Got my flight cancelled and nobody communicated any plans and the rebooking was done on a flight the day after when spots were open on flights the same day but apparently I had to pay an extra to be rebooked on the same day. Completely unprofessional."
"✅ Trip Verified | Booked ticket from Toronto to Montreal directly from their website with my personal mail ID and contact details. They cancelled the flight, at the last minute they said flight cancelled, gave another one for next day. At least they should inform one day prior or have to arrange another flight or airline at the same time. This is not for the first time. Even though I am aware about their pathetic service, I choose this one only because there was no alternate option. They do not value the customers time, they behave like its their right to cancel any flight at any time. Also they haven't provided me food and accommodation. Its around 8 hours, my luggage is not returned, waiting at the airport. Very very bad service Porter Airlines, not at all recommended to any one."
"Not Verified |  It was a pleasure from start to finish flying with Porter. The specific flight was PD403. Tha amenities were great. Wifi free, snacks free. Provided by a friendly professional staff. The booking and boarding went ultra smooth. Helpful and courteous from the get go. Pretty impressive considering it was an almost inaugural flight. I would recommend Porter to everyone. Would like to thank Teyana, Lauren and Chazito. It's staff like that and a more then competent pilot and FO that makes flying a positive experience that you want to repeat. Kudos Porter."
"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Porter for the first time on their inaugural flight from YYZ to YUL. The plane was a brand new (delivered in Dec 2022) Embraer E195-E2 (C-CKQL) and I was given seat 26C. Boarding started around 10 minutes late as the crew was relocating some of the passengers for balancing issues. We boarded the plane which was half empty. We took off around 45 minutes late due to a ""small technical issue"". There was free Wi-Fi available throughout the flight (including take-off and landing) as well as one power outlet per passenger. Take-off was smooth, beverages and a snack were served and we landed with a 30 minute delay. Landing was among the smoothest I have ever experienced. The crew was really nice."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Emma, a flight attendant who was working on flight PD 2137, from Toronto to Newark that departed at 3:00pm on January 31st 2023, is wonderful. She was kind, effective and quick, helped passengers to their seats and managed a plethora of issues, before the flight took off. I received very difficult news just before boarding. I was emotional, tearing up but trying to hide it. Emma, observant of my emotions, quietly came and brought me some ice to sooth my face and some water. She asked if I was okay and if I needed to talk. Throughout the flight she continued to be such a thoughtful, caring and kind person. Going out of her way to care for me. When leaving, she gave me hug. Her compassion was exceptionally appreciated. This is clearly above and beyond what Porter customer service is - Emma however, brought her emotional intelligence to the job. May she be known and celebrated for that. Emma made the difference for me today. "
"✅ Trip Verified | This is the absolute WORST experience I have ever had on an airplane. We left Montreal on a short flight to Toronto to catch a connection back to Chicago. After supposed weather delays, we were diverted to Sudbury, Canada, sat on the runway, deplaned, got back on the plane, sat on the runway again and flew back to Toronto. While waiting in Sudbury, we were informed that our flight to Chicago had been cancelled with no explanation from Porter as to what we were supposed to do. We were booked for a flight to Chicago on January 5th though - 5 days later stuck in Toronto with hotel and all other expenses not compensated for at all. We had to get a hotel and pay another airline to take us back home (at a huge expense). I cannot believe that there was nothing done to accommodate passengers or give any help in getting them to their next destination. I will NEVER recommend this airline or fly with them again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Save yourself, fly any other airline. Our Porter Airlines flight from Montreal to Toronto was diverted to Sudbury. We waited in a small holding area for hours. No food and limited bathroom usage. Not enough seats for half the people crammed in the space. We were boarded and flown back to Toronto only to have our flight to Chicago cancelled. This was 12/31, we were rebooked for 1/5. We both work and have kids at home so there was no way we were able to spend an additional 5! days in Toronto. Customer service was of no help. We ended up purchasing tickets on a different airline to get home. I would never use this airline again under any circumstance."
"✅ Trip Verified | Flight suddenly got delayed, hour after hour when they knew the weather forecast was going to be bad all day. They should have let us all know if advance. They also started offering “dinner vouchers” in secret, I did not get notified about any of this until I excited the boarding area, and went back to the check-in booths and demanded compensation. They agreed to pay for my dinner, but the dinner voucher was 15 CAD, in what airport do you think dinner is 15 dollars? Do you guys think I’m buying lays and Pepsi for dinner? Such disrespect."
"✅ Trip Verified | Horrible customer service. Unreliable. No seat recline. No WiFi on board. No airline app. Just a horrible experience all around. They issue weather change permits, but not even their own airport agents can process them and they force you to call their call center and wait on the phone for hours when you are staring right at a check-in agent doing nothing at the airport."
"Not Verified |  This is a very unreliable airline. Our first flight to Toronto canceled, we rebooked for 3 hours later and that flight was delayed for another hour so total of 4 hours delayed for first flight. Then the second flight delayed for another hour and half. So about 6 hours of delay in one trip. If you are on right schedule do not risk it and avoid this airline."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was cancelled due to weather, rebooked to more than 24h later. Only option is a credit that has to be used within less than a year or you lose your money and they don’t communicate with you at all about their decision, you need to magically look under your user ID with them. Porter used to feel fresh, now it feels like a grind. Will travel by train next time."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolute worst airline I’ve ever flown! My original flight was cancelled by the airline without notice and I was put on a different flight, which then got cancelled. After changing to a 3rd flight , I learned that this new flight was now delayed for more than 4 hours. We received no food vouchers, no apologies, even after I learned some passengers had been waiting at the gate for more than 7 hours. I was so fed up with the entire experience that I was ready to just cancel my trip and return home. They told me to call customer service to inquire about a refund as this was not an option they could provide. I was on hold with customer service for an hour with no answer. With no certainty of a refund, I chose to board the flight to Toronto after all. As we approached Toronto, they told us the plane couldn’t land at the airport due to weather conditions and the flight was diverted to Hamilton. After an entire day of delays and cancellations, we were now stranded at an airport hours away from our intended destination. The shuttle service provided to transport everyone to Toronto took more than 2 hours to arrive. We stood in the cold watching the entire flight crew drive off in luxury car service. While I do appreciate the pilots getting us on the ground safely, I feel that customer service was extremely lacking. Save yourself the frustaration and headache, and use another airline."
"✅ Trip Verified | The flight was delayed twice but that's not the irritating part. They said my carry-on was too big. I've taken 3 flights in the past week with it and it was fine. The attendant said try it, if it doesn't fit, you'll have to check it. It fit just fine under the seat in front of me! The problem was my husband sitting next to me had the same carryon and we couldn't fit both of them under the seats (the overhead was indeed too small). Since the flight was only half full, I'm not kidding maybe less than half, we asked if he could sit in an empty row and put his bag under those seats. They said no. He was not allowed putting his bag under any seat except his assigned seating. Is that really a rule? I've never encountered that before. So we had to check one of our carry-ons and had trouble at baggage claim because it wasn't there. They never told us it wasn't going with the regular baggage. So more delays, and just really aggravating because we go to the trouble of bringing thimble sized toothpaste and moisturizer, and take it all out yo display for TSA just so we can skip baggage only to be forced to do it needlessly. The crew was not helpful at all."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I was set to flyout Nov 4 at 8am to pick up a new car in Toronto. I got an email saying my flight was delayed from 8am to now 5:40Pm. This alone is already bad but things happen and I get it. I tried to to switch my flight online for hours and it was not letting me what so ever. I tried their “chat function” and surprise of course that was not available either. I was on hold on the phone for 3 hours and no one picked up (what a surprise). Since I could not transfer my flight online or get a hold of anyone since apparently this is to hard for Porter I had to take that flight and book a hotel to spend the night in Toronto and pick up my vehicle the following morning since the dealership was closed at that time. Another thing to note is my flight was delayed another 3 times! I did not leave Ottawa till 7:40pm (Almost 12hrs later than my initial flight). I talked to a Porter representative at the airport and they basically said file a complaint online we cant help you. I filed my complaint asking to be at least compensated for the hotel room I had to get due to their terrible customer service and they said it’s not their problem and they wont be helping. I will never fly porter again. Terrible customer service"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Quite disappointing. 49$ fee for carry on luggage barely feels like the ""premium"" airline branding they give themselves. And to top it off, if you don't opt in for it you don't get an online boarding pass and need to queue to obtain it. This is low cost carrier practise and quite deceiving."
"✅ Trip Verified | In the last two rows of the plane and four of us were trying to sleep. Two flight attendants couldn’t stop talking the whole flight about skateboarding and scooters. None of us could sleep and the attendants didn’t seem to care at all. Very unsatisfactory service. WestJet I should have taken your later flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We received an email letting us know our flight the next morning had been cancelled at 9pm the night before, and we had been rebooked on a flight 3 days laterR. We had connecting flights to our home in Australia that we would have missed, but the Porter team, nice as they were, were unable to do anything to get us on a suitable flight. Not even a hotel room. $2000 later and we’re booked on a 5am Air Canada flight, the only feasible way to make our international connection. Would not recommend."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I traveled to Washington Dc on Porter airlines with wheelchair assist. I left a therapy cushion in the airport lounge. When I asked the flight attendant if someone could get it and bring it onto the still- boarding aircraft, she said a ground staffer would bring it. That did not work out, so after a word from the flight attendant, the pilot got off the plane, found the cushion and brought it to me. Magnificent service. Fly Porter."
"✅ Trip Verified | I would rather crawl to my destination than ever have to fly with this airline again. The customer service is unbelievably bad. The facilities are old, dirty, and uncomfortable. The flight attendants are rude and unprofessional. The check in agents are virtually useless and have little to no idea what they are doing. The entire flight likely knows the life story of the flight attendants as they sat in the very back row and talked loudly enough for the pilot to hear the entire flight, which was at 7 in the morning. They had their belongings strewn across the back row, not properly stowed for any of the flight, including take-off and touch down, meanwhile chastising passengers for having purses on their laps. They cancelled our flight 7 hours before we were scheduled to depart due to ""crew unpreparedness"" and no reimbursements for anything were offered at all. We had to pay to stay another night in a foreign country after they rescheduled our flight to 24 hours later. I cannot believe an airline like this is allowed to fly or is still in business. Spirit seems like first class after this. I’m still shocked we made it to our destination safely. Avoid at all costs!"
"Not Verified | Thunder Bay to Toronto. Second time this weekend that there was a last minute cancellation for us with no explanation, no compensation besides having to wait for the “next available flight” which one of them was the next day and the other was a 2 hour wait."
"Not Verified | Newark to Thunder Bay via Toronto. Part of this poor experience with Porter was due to weather so that's out of Porter's control and I understand that, however when my husband's flights were rebooked (after being cancelled twice) he was always rebooked on the last flight of the day, which doesn't make sense to me because if earlier flights are delayed for long enough then won't the last flight be cancelled? And that's exactly what happened on the second day. Anyway, when his flight was rebooked the second time, he was in Toronto (after arriving from Newark) and for some reason the person who booked this flight selected the departing location as Newark again, so when he arrived at the airport for his flight they couldn't locate him (because he was in Toronto, not Newark) and they said they couldn't do anything for him. So while he's in Billy Bishop, he had to call customer service to fix the flight information and after about half an hour it was finally fixed and he was given his boarding pass. It just seemed like incompetence or carelessness, and we were ready to cut our losses and book with WestJet or something instead."
"✅ Trip Verified |  They cancelled my flight and after delaying my new flight 6+ times, cancelled that one too. Booked me for a new flight the following day and delayed that one too. Worst flying experience ever."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We took Porter Airlines from Montreal to Toronto, our flight was supposed to be at 5:15pm, but we were told that they will not be able to take all of our luggage so we must travel with our luggage on the next flight at 9pm. By the time we arrived in Toronto on the later flights, we were told that Our luggage will be arriving on the next day flight. We got 4 of our luggage delivered on the second day in damaged condition. It took more than 1 1/2 month to process my damage claim after several calls and emails. Then one month after that I was told to buy 4 bags (around $700worth), submit a claim and they will reimburse me. I submitted my receipt for the new luggage, it has been over 7 weeks; I still did not get my reimbursement. I have made numerous calls to the person who sent me confirmation, the baggage claim, customer service and several other department to find out the status. No one is responding to my inquiry nor the claim. Very slow process to everything -no use of calling Customer service or any other departments -no one is owing up the responsibilities. Very poor customer care."
"✅ Trip Verified |  After booking a flight to visit family based on FB promotional ads promoting no fees on changes or cancellations, I purchased 2 tickets and in addition purchased the ""refund option"" as they call it, which I assumed was just hassle free cancellation / refund option in case we had to cancel. Due to the pandemic and new variants, and also changing travel guidelines within our province, we were no longer comfortable flying so decided to cancel. I paid $868 for the flights, and then through cancellation process the refund amount was showing $811 as the ancillary fee apparently does not get refunded. So upon arriving to the last step in the cancellation to confirm the $811 refund, I submitted only to find out I was now getting a $753 refund. So despite the promotions and buying ""cancellation protection"", I still ended paying $115 penalty for cancelling my flight."
"✅ Trip Verified | I booked 2 flight through Expedia for Porter Airlines. They canceled all flights to Atlantic provinces including my flights. I had to come up with more money to book new flights on a different airline. I was told that I was supposed to get a refund from Porter Airlines but despite my contacting them and having Expedia contact them twice on my behalf I've still not received a refund. I have been fighting ever since July 2021 to try and get my refund. I am out hundreds of dollars and I don't think I'll ever see it again. Absolutely ridiculous. Don't book with this airline."
"Not Verified |  Really happy with experience - friendly employees, the interior of planes looked recently updated, happy to avoid Pearson and fly through Toronto Island - brand new looking airport with good amenities. Price was great, too. Would definitely fly again."
"Not Verified |  Toronto to Montreal. Continue to be impressed with the service at Porter! My friends and I were travelling (returning home) on the brink of the COVID-19 crisis and the entire crew remained upbeat, pleasant and incredibly professional during our pre-boarding and flight. Thank you to the Porter Airline organization for getting us home safely and with ease."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Fredericton to Ottawa. A very bad experience for a first flight. I am currently waiting for the flight which got delayed, so far, 3 times for a total of 4 hours and 15 minutes. I tried to locate an agent to ask about the reason for the delay, none was available at their gate. No wonder why their tickets are cheaper than others."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ottawa to Toronto. My first flight was cancelled, the airline said that it was plane trouble. I was bumped to a later flight and we landed 20 minutes ago. We are still sitting on the tarmac not moving waiting for a gate to pull in. This is terrible service. We have landed more than 20 mins ago and no one will tell us anything or get us off this flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ottawa to Fredericton. We have to sit here for nearly 2 hours to fly 1.5 hours. Plane was very warm and air didn't work.  I can understand maybe an hour delay, but 2 hours. Come on porter, be prepared. "
"Not Verified |  Fredericton to Ottawa. Porter isn't much different than any other airline in size or quantity but they can't be on time if they tried. I have flown Porter 5 times now and every single flight has always been delayed."
"Not Verified |  Ottawa to Newark via Toronto. Received an alert two days prior to the flight that due to weather flight would be delayed or cancelled and that I could rebook free of charge. They only gave options for the same day of the original flight. Thus, I booked after the storm would have passed. Less than 12 hrs before the rebooked flight Porter cancelled my flight and then rebooked me on a different flight that would have missed my connection, landing me back in NYC seven hours later than planned and with a layover of five hrs. Tried to call customer service only to be disconnected after hr and a half wait with no call back. Called back only for another hour expected wait time.  Ended up booking AirCanada same route, same time with zero hassle or delay. "
"Not Verified | Toronto to Ottawa. I have flown with Porter Airlines over ten times three years ago. I gave it five stars back then but haven't flown with it since until this month. I found the service quality and overall experience has deteriorated to a huge extent. What attracted me previously no longer exists. They start charging even an everyday backpack. I wonder if they are going to charge passengers who use the underwater tunnel or ferry to get onto the Toronto city airport in the future."
"Not Verified |  Halifax to Toronto via Ottawa. Charged me $80 because my bags were too big for the carry on. Even after going through checkin fine they charge me before I board. I already paid for a cabin and carry-on, they force me to check in my bag."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ottawa to Toronto. Enjoyed flying with Porter to Toronto City Airport. This is a great experience landing on Toronto islands and getting to the city by walking down a tunnel for a couple of minutes. Porter is a small Canadian airline connecting eastern Canadian cities and having a couple of US cities in their destinations too. As far as my single experience with Porter, it was a nice one."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Toronto.  The booking page repeatedly showed that my booking for an urgent flight was unsuccessful after several attempts. However, they charged my card without any acknowledgement nor confirmation. I was only able to find out the charge 4 days later and they refused to refund me for errors caused by their system glitch. Call centre is useless and customer service is non-existent - they’d do nothing but read off their scripted procedure."
"Not Verified |  Since I never received a Boarding Pass due to no one being at the counter to fly back to Montreal, it can not be a verified review unless I use the one on 8 November, 2019 which had the same issues except I didn't miss my flight. You see Porter Airlines on has someone at the counter for 1 hr prior to the flight and that is the only way you can receive your boarding pass, which is a ridiculous practice and I can not imagine that this policy serves them well. On November 10, 2019 I arrived at Dulles Airport 55 minutes prior to my departure time due to a traffic incident. I go to the counter to find it empty and no one to give me a boarding pass, I called their customer service no. to be received by a very rude person stating that I should have been there one hour ahead of my flight, which I would have if not stuck on the 95 in Washington DC, I was 5 minutes short. You can not use a kiosk to get your boarding pass and you can not get a mobile boarding pass. I had to buy another flight on another airline in a different airport to get back home. In Montreal I was 2 hrs early for my flight and again no one was at the counter, and even though I was early I had to stand there waiting for someone to come to work at Porter to get a boarding pass, so instead of getting through security and customs a bit early I was rushed and running to my gate. I will never use this airline again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Montreal to Boston via Toronto in August 2019. There was a delay from Montréal so we missed the flight to Boston because we had a stop in Toronto. As soon as we arrived to Toronto they were professional and suggested a hotel room in order to take the flight the day after, but we have to pay the taxi and we will be refunded. I did so and I sent them all the bills. I’m still waiting, I haven’t received anything and their response in the email is always the same : we are sorry."
"Not Verified |  Toronto to Montreal. I have a hearing disability and after a miscommunication and missed flight (which happens often for me, no fault of anyone's) the extent that the staff went to after understanding my hearing disability was incredible. An agent collected me from the restaurant and brought me to the boarding gate, was personable and relatable, most importantly authentic. I truly felt appreciated. Even as I was sat in my seat I was offered water, Jessica and Bianca (I believe) treated me like I mattered and I have never found that elsewhere. I'm so grateful to get home later than I hoped but have this experience in exchange. Customer service that other airlines simply don't have. "
"Not Verified | Timmins to Ottawa via Toronto. Having flown a week before with Porter under the basic airfare, I assumed the same bag containing the same things would be acceptable for my return flight. I was told when checking in that I would need to pay an extra 50$ for my bag as it was over the capacity for a personal item. I explained the situation and was told I would have to pay the 50$ to take my bag as they must not have checked my bag thoroughly enough leaving Ottawa. It's important to note I have been flying with Porter for over 3 years, flying approximately 10 times a year, with the same bag and this has been the first time it has been an issue. Luckily Air Canada still offers a personal item and a carry on for a cheaper rate. As such I will be flying Air Canada from now on."
"Not Verified | Halifax to Toronto via Montreal. Brutal baggage fees on this airline and very rude ground staff. Charged me $51 dollars for a small backpack that fit no problem in the overhead bin. I don’t pay that much to check a bag to go to Europe. Thank goodness there is a choice as I will never fly this airline again. They simply don’t care about their customers which seems like a bizarre way to run a business."
"✅ Trip Verified | Newark to Toronto. Lovely flight, friendly flight attendants. I particularly like the leather seats and cabin ambience. The free beer and snacks were unexpected. I have to say, after completing a ‘red-eye’ from Oregon earlier that morning I was pleasantly surprised. Thank you, Porter."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Windsor to Toronto. Terrible customer service. Worst experience. They charged us 50$ for one bag because we couldn’t fit it into our other bags."
"✅ Trip Verified | Halifax to Montreal. Waited 1 hour and 15 minutes for my luggage. The porter representatives told me they wait for all their flights to come in before realeasing the checked in luggage. Spoke to a representative on their Facebook chat and they seem to not care about their service and did not respond not even a sorry for the inconvenience. Not normal to see the Air Canada flight come in 30 minutes after I landed and they got their luggage within 10 minutes! I will never fly this airline again never! For the same price I’ll book AC next time for my upcoming trips!"
"Not Verified |  Flew Ottawa to Halifax. My wife and I want to acknowledge the fantastic care we received from an employee of Porter Airlines, who helped us so much at a very difficult moment at the airport in Halifax. The other agents also took great care to change our tickets that could suit my medical condition after I suffered from an unbearable migraine while landing onto Halifax airport. Thank you."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ottawa to Saint John. We purchased tickets, costing over $1300 and due to a medical emergency we had to cancel our vacation. Porter Airlines did not refund our money, charged us a cancellation fee and gave us a credit that is basically unusable. Do not fly Porter Airlines"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Montréal to Toronto. The customer service is rude and they lied about the size of carry-on luggage so they can charge you more money. They charge you small carry on luggage as long as the luggages have wheels. In the end you will pay more than any other airlines."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Windsor to Toronto. Worst customer service when checking in bags. The website lies about the size of the carry on bags. The staff that take care of check ins are very arrogant and rude as if they are paying out of their pocket for your flight. I will never recommend this airline."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A colleague and I took a plane from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario to Billy Bishop Airport in Toronto. We boarded the plane at 5:40 pm. Estimated time of arrival was 7:00 pm. We first realized something was up when the plane began descending and shortly after it ascended. This happened several times. No one informed us as to what was happening until a short time later. An announcement was made that they were having difficulty landing and that they were low on fuel and had to take us to Hamilton Airport. We finally landed in Hamilton at approximately 8:10 pm. We were informed that a shuttle bus would take us to Billy Bishop Airport. Slowly people were getting discouraged and began taking cabs back to Toronto. At 9:40 pm. I approached an individual who said he was overseeing the ""incident"" and then announced to me that the shuttle bus would be another hour. There were only a handful of people left at that time. We gave up waiting. We were tired and hungry. No offer of coffee or anything of that nature. Many were disappointed and frustrated. Some had tickets for the Raptors game. They basically dropped us at the airport and left us in the lurch. So much for customer service."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Montreal. I had an otherwise great experience with Porter. The flight attendants, customer service people, etc. were very polite. However, I booked a basic trip and I booked this through cheapoair. Little to my knowledge, a proper carry on is not included and I was charged a fee when I arrived to the gate which I couldn't help but pay (I can't leave my carry on behind obviously). I would have been completely fine with that - I understand that airlines are increasing fees, it is part of the state of the economy. However, I was not made aware of this  on cheapoair's website. A customer service agent (when I made a complaint) told me that Porter's website and cheapoair both warn you but when I tried to book the same basic fare on Porter website in fact it did warn me and very specifically (no carry on etc.). Cheapoair just said ""only a 20 ib personal item"" - well my carry on was extremely small and less than 20 pounds. Honestly, I wouldn't mind any of this but when I complained about it with Porter and I sent them the screenshots and the difference between the warnings on Cheapoair and Porter, they did nothing. That alone means that I will likely never fly porter again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Boston. On the first leg of the journey, the gate agent indicated he would call ahead to hold the plane due to a long line at security. He apparently did not as five passengers did not make the flight. On the return flight, the gate agent indicated a carry on baggage fee was applicable which I disputed. Once through security, two managers followed me and then had my name called not for passport check but to ransom carry on baggage fee. Very poor customer service"
"✅ Trip Verified |  The on board service was great - smiling flight attendants. However, we dealt with an unforeseen circumstance on the day that we were flying. My wife and I were at the boarding gate waiting for our flight. She was very unwell and I had to bring her to the emergency. As much as I understand that we had booked on a special fare, we were at the boarding gate and my wife was unwell. To add fuel to the fire, I realized that my cellphone accidentally fell off my pocket and it was in the car rental that I returned at the airport. It was too late for me to board that flight. The Porter Airlines employee at the check in desk showed no empathy or compassion  about the circumstance and instead just reiterated about the change fee policy in a grouchy tone! I understand that we were on a special fare. However, it did not cost the airline anything to put us on to the next flight where there were lots of seats available given the fact that the reservation was directly booked through the Porter Airlines website. The airline employee chose to stick to the company policy and not show any compassion to a valuable customer and generate that goodwill. Porter has two lost customers due to this!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Halifax to Ottawa. There was a $10 difference in standard vs basic and I chose to book basic. They charged me $39 not $25 for my golf bag and then told me instead of my 2 carry ons I was not allowed a carry on, only a personal item. I asked if a back pack could be my personal item and the guy gave me dimensions - when asked if an average sized back pack can be a personal item he said I don't know the size of an average backpack. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst staff attitude ever. I was on my way from US to Montreal via Toronto and forgot my portable charger in the NY to Toronto flight with 2 credit cards on the backside of it. As soon as I was at security check for my connecting flight to Montreal, I realised it and informed the porter desk in the lounge. They called the aircraft staff and got to know that they found the stuff. Since I had a flight in next 15 minutes, they told me to jump on the flight and that they would send my stuff in the next flight which was just after 30 mins of this flight. They asked me to speak with the portal staff in Montreal. I contacted their staff at the Montreal airport and they said we did not get any message about any such suff left. I said pls check my file and that they would put the note on my file as they assured me at the Toronto airport. The lady did not even bother to check this and asked me to wait for 30 mins till the next flight arrives. I waited for almost 40 mins and then asked the lady again so she said she is going to check on the flight which just arrived. She comes after another 10 mins and does not even bother to inform me as to whether she found it or not. I go to her again and she carelessly says that they havent sent anything in this flight. I told her that I have my 2 credit cards in it and no cash left. She suggested me to contact the manager in the departure area. When I went there, the manager contacted the staff at Toronto airport and he was continually asking me to whom I got in touch with at the Toronto airport. I said I did not ask the name. He said that he is not able to know whom I contacted and that they dont know whether they found my stuff? I said that I am sure that they had found it and they were going to send that in the next flight. Finally, they just gave me a recipe of lost stuff and asked me to wait for a call. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Out of all the many times I've flown and traveled, I must say Porter Airlines is by far the worst way to travel. During the Easter weekend after purchasing a one way nonstop flight from Toronto to Thunder Bay for almost $500, a week in advance, my flight was at the very last minute changed to a 6 hours flight that made a stop in Sue Saint Marie. Considering my driver was stuck waiting for 4 hours and I was not alerted about the flight change until boarding the plane, they offered me no compensation at all and told me that the case is closed and I should be happy that they were able to get to the people to Sue Saint Marie in time for Easter. So they forced me to be late so others could be on time even though I paid to be on time, a one way nonstop flight which I did not get. So if you're looking to get what you paid for, not get ripped off, and get good customer service, I would suggest you pick a different airline as they cant not provide any of the above. Worst customer service ever. Worst flight ever."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Montreal to Thunder Bay via Toronto. Todd and Sandra were very helpful today and I wanted to point their efforts out. Flight was delayed/cancelled after boarding due to a mistake of a loading dock staff’s part. Todd was pleasant & calm in booking me & my travelling partners on a new flight. Sandra was a joy to deal with too. Thanks in part to them, our delayed experience was pleasant."
"Not Verified |  Chicago to Toronto with Porter Airlines. I paid premium for my flight and the agent charged me $39 for a carry on bag. She insisted I have to check it in. I fly with this on all airlines."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Newark. If you want to depart at 6, get a ticket for 4. It is not only impossible for this airline to leave on time, they do not communicate delays. Of course, no one expects much from airlines, but the level of sheer disrespect to customers by Porter is out of control. If you’re returning to Toronto in the evening, that delay might cause you to be rerouted with no compensation. Horrible customer service, avoid if possible.It is surely a first world complaint, but few things cause me as much annoyance as porter airlines."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have traveled Porter many times from their inception. I have seen them grow and have participated in my of their growing pains. I was also very thrilled with the level of service I received and was impressed by the friendliness of the Air Hostesses. The ground staff - though not always pleasant were never rude. The reason for my review this time is the appalling Basic Economy Structure I was surprised with. They charge you $39.40 or something when you try to check in. This should have been made clear when I first booked the ticket and should not have been a surprise item. This was particularly painful because I had the onward journey with Air Canada and the return with Porter. With the new facelift of the terminal Porter niceties are gone - like free coffee and cookies etc. Now a breakfast sandwich costs $15.99. I am all for paying for convenience but this in my opinion is a ripoff. I am happy to note the rest of the service remains the same."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Montreal to Toronto. Not happy with the service. Porter airlines advertises cheap prices but then surprise you with extra fees for carry on bags. Don’t fool yourselves, it’s not actually as cheap as they say. Air Canada is way better and better service. This is my first and last time flying with Porter."
"Not Verified |  Porter has fallen from the level of service and quality it once had. YOW lounge permanently closed. Cheapest fares (basic) now do not include a carry-on, and their definition of ""personal item"" is very narrow. I paid for the carry-on allowed fare, and was told that my bag was over the 9kg limit for carry on. These are not practices of a premium or comfort airline. These are practices I haven't encountered since I flew super discount airlines in Southeast Asia. Flight was delayed almost two hours because crew was late. Upon landing at YTZ, we had to wait 15 minutes because another plane was at our gate. Then it was another 15 minutes to wait for carry on luggage to be released because they were short staffed that night. So much for ""flying refined""..."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Montreal. They have completely changed over the last five years I will never use them again. They rip you off on your baggage fee if you don’t book it online. However they don’t tell you that!! When you arrive at the airport you cannot book your baggage charge on a separate booking station you have to wait for over one hour to speak to aN airline associate. I had to wait over one hour in the line up because their was only one person serving hundreds of people flying out yesterday. Then when I got to the line up she charged me over $44 for my baggage fee! On the way down I flew with westjet who charged me $30 On top of everything else, I had to ask this associate four times to give me a receipt and to return my photo Id. They use to be the best airline, Use air Canada or west jet in the future"
"✅ Trip Verified | Toronto to Washington. The good days are over (from a customer perspective)! I've been flying Porter for years, literally the day after they opened the Toronto-Washington route in 2011. Everything was fantastic until they reached a critical mass, and they sold the airport to an external investor. No more free coffee and snacks in the lounge, overall service is terrible, check-in staff is now just as indifferent as with any other major airline (maybe also as a result of a looming first time strike, as they protest bad management and disappearing benefits), price and frequent flyer structure is far less attractive than it used to be. Don't get me wrong: Porter is not worse than any other (North American) Airline, but they used to be so much better in almost all areas, and they are now just the same. I used to feel special based on how they treated me (even without their ""VIP"" program), now I have the same stupid cattle feeling as I have flying any other major airline. Growth and prosperity is certainly desirable, and I saw how Porter developed over the last few years. Unfortunately it has slowly followed the trend of most other carriers, and I have no incentive anymore to choose Porter. It's just too bad."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Toronto. I am appalled how bad this airline is. Loud prop planes with no TVs and not even wifi. But worse is the fact that a huge snowstorm was hitting the day I was due to return and they don't wave change fees in advance like  other airline. They only wave change fees if your flight is canceled or delayed significantly which means everyone is left scrambling the day off a major weather event. This is especially galling for an airline that operates out of a city that gets its share of winter weather."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have never received such terrible customer service in my life. My flight from Moncton to Ottawa was cancelled due to weather conditions (understandable) and I was sent an email asking not to contact Porter, stating that they would contact me with the next available flight information. I waited for hours and heard nothing from them. I ended up heading to the airport in hopes that I would be able to get on to the next flight that was going out. When I was told no, I asked when the next available flight was and they told me 8 days from when I was supposed to fly out,they told me I should have phoned them because everyone else did and they were able to get onto the next outgoing flights. Though, the email stated not to contact them. And apparently, they had no intention on contacting me either. They just hoped I would find another way home and they would get to keep my money. I ended up having to get a 24 hour, $200 train ticket to get home. To top it off, I received terrible customer service from everyone and was told they would not compensate me in any way for this terrible and costly inconvenience. My flight to Moncton was delayed by several hours. Porter is cheap but by the time you pay for missing your transportation (not to mention the time you spend waiting on a delayed airplane) it's just not worth the penny pinching. "
"✅ Trip Verified | They lost our luggage on a one hour flight from Sudbury to Toronto. One of our checked bags made it however the other did not. The reasoning was due to an off loading and unloading error. Meaning they took it off and forgot to put it back on. Absolutely ridiculous, almost comical the care factor from the luggage people. Do not recommend unless you plan on traveling with no luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Toronto. Always love Porter for the free food and drinks. Staff are usually lovely, but the stewartess on this flight was awful. When we walked in she was picking her nails and didn't even look up as she grabbed our ticket to check the flight number. Everything she said was said rudely and as if she would rather be anywhere else. She may as well have been rolling her eyes when doing the safety presentation. She is the only reason I am writing this review. Maybe she was having a bad day, but her demeanour was wildly unprofessional. Otherwise I usually love flying Porter."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Newark. If you are flying with a family or if you are pregnant, do not fly with porter. We are a seasoned traveling family, we have two kids and a dog and my wife is pregnant. Generally, flying is tough, but we know what we are in for and come prepared. We checked two bags, and had a small carry on as well. They asked us to weigh the carry on, which they do not ask of people who check in online, and it was 2kg overweight. Rather than use her judgment and let it slide, the attendant made us unpack a bunch of stuff and put it in another bag. She sighted “policy” and “safety” as reasons why it needed to be done, but clearly it was unnecessary. And why enforce the rules on a family with two kids, a pregnant mom, and a dog, when single business men get away with heavy carry ons?  It’s been a terrible time on this airline in both directions and we will never fly with them again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  St John's to Halifax. Horrible airline. Last time I used them they made me remove stuff from my carry on for weight. And they broke my suitcase, I never received a replacement. This time they charged me for a check in bag and another $60 for carry on.  Ridiculous. Also my suitcase was broken again, but after complaining enough I received a replacement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Boston. Simply put, Porter Airlines does not deliver. They take your money and book flights at specified times but repeatedly cancel and delay flights and bump you to later flights to consolidate flyers, while being slow, robotic, and apologetic. They will tell you it’s a maintenance issue or weather issue but as a frequent flyer, this cannot always be the case. This is bad business practice in my opinion and they get away with it. They have done Toronto a disservice, and are lowering tourist potential."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Halifax to Ottawa. Porter Airlines may charge you for carry on when you book with a third party. I recently got hit with 100 dollar fee to take a 6lb carry on bag on a Basic Economy fare. If you use a third party to try to ease the cost of travel, you may be unable to take anything. I was unaware of FlightHub arrangement for finding a cheaper flight. When I booked with FlightHub, there was no way this information came up visible to see. It may be there in the extra fine print, but not where I could have made a decision not to book with Porter."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Toronto. They closed the gate 20 minutes before departure, the plane was at the gate but they would not let me board.  Nearly three hours later they issued a boarding pass for another flight."
"✅ Trip Verified | Toronto City to Montreal. Flight was late departing. No option to select seat at check in (only for a fee). Over the years this airline’s meals have decreased from a sandwich into a pack of almonds. Seats were not that clean and it smelled bad (my seat was near the bathrooms)."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Newark. I had a nice experience with Porter Airlines. When I arrived to EWR, they automatically offered me a ticket on an earlier flight which landed in Toronto a hour and a half earlier than the flight I was booked on, so I accepted it. Check in was quick and easy and the staff was very friendly. The flight itself was great. The flight attendants were constantly cleaning the plane and walking through collecting trash. Landing in Toronto City airport was nice because it took about 10 minutes to go through customs, collect my suitcase from baggage claim, and head to free bus from the airport to the city. I had the same great experience on my return trip. I would love to fly with Porter Airlines again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  
Washington to Montréal via Toronto. I flew with Porter to come to Washington. On Friday, my flight was delayed for 1 hour and 30 minutes in Montreal, which made me miss my connecting in Toronto. I had to wait another 2 hours for the next flight. On my way back, I had a flight coming back on Sunday. My flight was cancelled and they gave me tickets for the first flight in the morning. I'm standing near the gate right now. The plane arrived 45 minutes late and my initial flight is now delayed for 45 minutes, which will make me miss my connecting going to Montreal. I will never fly again with Porter."
"✅ Trip Verified |  My family had a very stressful experience with Porter Airlines. Our flight was canceled going back from Toronto to Boston and we had to miss two days of work. They did not offer any kind of compensation or help. Very disappointed and we will never use Porter again, since they do not want to give us any compensation."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I was to fly to Toronto from Sault Ste. Marie at 13:55pm on September 3, 2018, only to have my Porter flight cancelled that day. I received an email about this cancellation, so thank goodness I noticed the email before leaving for the airport. As Porter rebooked me on the next available flight, I would not have arrived until well into the late evening. Then I was scrambling to make other arrangements, as I had kidney surgery the following day in Hamilton and arriving in Hamilton after 9:30pm would not have been acceptable.. My Aunt had travelled from Ottawa, to pick me up in Toronto, in order to drive me to Hamilton, from the Toronto airport. Not only did this disrupt her plans for the day, as she is not from Toronto, but I needed to be driven to Hamilton, in order to eat, rest and be at the hospital for 6am the following morning. I have all hospital documents to support my surgery information. The new Porter reschedule on September 3rd would have made me arrive in Hamilton extremely late at night, before a major surgery and not have time and energy to prep for the surgery properly. When I realized I could get on an earlier flight with Air Canada, I cancelled my entire, return Porter booking and was refunded by Porter. The Air Canada flights were more expensive and I expected to have those additional costs reimbursed to me.  I then rebooked my September 7th flight with Air Canada, as well, as I am unsatisfied with Porter and the way this flight was cancelled. I was so upset by this cancellation and did not want to fly with Porter again.  Porter did not respond to my request but sent me a $50 travel voucher. When I followed up about my fie they said I was not eligible for reimbursement."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Halifax to Toronto. Had to cancel a flight 30 hours before leaving and the web site says before 24 hours you get a refund. I only got 118 dollar credit for the return flight from a 475 dollar flight. Nothing from the departure. My guidelines were all by the rules to get a refund and I got robbed. I saved for three months and they took it like it was theirs."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Montreal to Halifax. My flight was cancelled for a reason they could have anticipated (Toronto airshow). The staff at the airport was so rude. They said they were unable to help book my accommodation, it was Labour Day. The cheapest room I could find was $600 and 45 mins from the airport. I submitted my request for reimbursement 6 weeks ago. Initially I was told it would take 2 weeks, now 6-8 weeks. I’m sure once that deadline has passed it will be something else. I am a student. I have been carrying the cost on my credit card and they’ve refused to reimburse my interest. I would not recommend flying with Porter."
"✅ Trip Verified | Chicago to Montreal via Toronto. Stay away. Plane underwent maintenance at the last minute, so 100 people had to be diverted onto other flights. And this was just on the way there. On the way back the same thing happened, again with no notice whatsoever. Unbelievably disorganized - even worst than Spirit or other budget airlines. Got a voucher for a hotel in the middle of nowhere, at least, with a $8 breakfast voucher. Complete joke."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Halifax to Toronto. Porter cancelled my flight without warning at 6:30am 30 minutes before the flight was supposed to leave. 20 minutes before my flight was supposed to leave, I received an email saying that I had been automatically rescheduled to another Halifax-Toronto flight taking place 3.5 days later. Other would-be passengers received emails saying they were put on flights a week late. Finally, when a customer service rep showed up at when takeoff was scheduled, she told us all we could do was go to the front desk and be refunded if we didnt want to take the flight Porter had automatically put us on. I waited in a very long line to talk to a customer service rep who was very unsympathetic and offered me no option except a refund, which I had to accept because I only arranged to spend the weekend in Halifax. I should also add that none of the passengers were given any explanation or the cancellation and when I asked, the rep said that a one member of the crew had called in sick. The flights to Toronto with other airlines at the airport were $700-900, which was much more expensive than the $339 ticket from Porter that I had purchased weeks before. I was not offered any compensation for this huge price hike but was given a meal coupon and told I could call a 1-800 number where someone may or may not cover some of the cost. When I asked for help in doing this, the customer service rep was unconcerned and said no. I ended up having to take the bus from Halifax to Toronto since there were no affordable flights and I needed to get to Toronto for school, work and appointments within the next 36 hours. The next day, while on a 31 hour long bus ride, I received an email from Porter with a $50 coupon for my ‘next’ flight with them, which I certainly will never use. Both the situation and Porter’s follow-up were unacceptable and I would advise against booking with them."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a 7am Flight from Halifax to Montreal. At 7am no personnel, only a screen that said Flight Cancelled. We had to ask Air Canada to get a Porter agent to come up after 15 minutes. A general message was given, sorry for inconvenience, flight is cancelled due to personnel sick and no other options all other flights are booked. They reimbursed but left us run to get another flight. It is oct 9 Thanksgiving so last minute flight was 700$ (the cheapest price). The offered 50$ on the next flight with Porter. Leaving us on our own, not paying for the difference. I did phone the Complaint and they hung up on me when I asked to talk to a supervisor to discuss the situation. Poor service, poor personnel, very bad company"
"✅ Trip Verified | Montreal to Newark via Toronto. Flying with Porter for the first time. And the last one. AM flight cancelled last minute. No alternative provided for the same day. Other people in the queue have been cancelled twice in the same day! Never again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Montreal. I am Porter Premium Access, which you think would come with cool perks but really it means I've been consistently delayed, disrupted and cancelled. I've started taking air Canada for work trips because I can't afford the risk that I'll be late or miss a meeting. I booked porter on a Saturday and sure enough, most flights were delayed and mine ended up being cancelled so I spent my Saturday afternoon trapped at the airport. Billy Bishop is doing major renovations and it's looking really good, but Porter Airlines does not offer the services to match this. Really disappointed in Porter and will continue to take Air Canada."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Halifax to St John's. I have flown twice with Porter but today was just something else. I have never seen an airline that charged me for a carry on bag at the airport. I didnt have any money coz i wasn't prepared for this charge. It was the most embarrassing moment of my life.  I just think this is something the airline have to direct immediately. If you want to charge then include it in your online price not surprise me as I check in."
"✅ Trip Verified |  St Johns to Montreal. I had a very negative experience I had with my Porter flight. I showed up at approximately 2pm for my flight - I showed my drivers licence ID to the customer service representative, and she said to come back in 1 hour to check in. I came back in 1 hour and was informed. “Oh, your driver's license is expired, we can’t accept it.” I was denied boarding. I argued that it was still a valid form of ID- and said ‘Only valid as photo ID’ on a sticker affixed by the licensing authorities in Ontario, but the customer care rep. Didn’t budge. I asked for a supervisor to be called but was denied. I was advised to call Porter Airlines to rebook / get a refund. After waiting on hold for 45 minutes I was informed “you have to call the travel agent that you booked it through”. Upon calling the travel agency, I was informed “porter airlines won’t let us refund or rebook the flight.” Part 2 By this time all the Porter Reps had left the wicket at the airport, so I had no further redress. Leaving me stranded, inconvenienced, and having to pay out an awful lot. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Quebec to Toronto. Cancelled/rebooked both flights on my way to and from Quebec. Weather conditions preventing flights is understandable but not the miserable job Porter did of rebooking flights with connections, and accommodating with hotels. They rebooked the 1st leg of a connection flight to a date after the 2nd leg. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Timmins to Toronto. Always disappointed with the having to wait in the airplane on the tarmac when landing for other aircraft boarding. This made me miss my plans for pick up. In addition, this flight was half an hour late and never posted as being delayed. Highly inconvenient and intend to use Air Canada leaving from Pearson on my next trip"
"✅ Trip Verified |  We went on a last minute trip to Montreal for the summer. Flight there was fine and had no problems. On our way home to Washington D.C. we had a connecting flight to Toronto (on a Friday). Midway from Montreal to Toronto we were flown back to Montreal, because Toronto had partially flooded due to weather issues. We waited on the plane in Montreal and they took us back to Billy Bishop Airport in Toronto. Once we had arrived at the airport, they told us they had canceled all flights to Washington D.C. until the next Wednesday (the day my siblings and I started school). Many other people were stuck at the airport (a couple from Chicago and a lady from somewhere in the U.S. and many others). We were told we would have to pay for new plane tickets for 6 people after we had already paid for the canceled flight. We were told we would get a small refund about a month later. We took a train to the Pearson airport and got a rental van that we drove 10 hours in back to our home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Newark. Porter is the west airline. My flight was delayed 45 minutes and then cancelled. I was then booked onto a flight 9 hours later. There was no communication. In fact, only if a person is standing at the screen at the airport, there is no indication of what is happening. Sure, there are updates on you’re phone but no announcements. Beyond poor communication, the attendants are obviously poorly trained. I went to the counter to check on my delay. As the attendant is checking my flight status her phone rings. She picks up and walks away without explanation. I stood there for 10 minutes before her colleagues decided she should help me. My return flight was equally dissatisfying. Without any explanation, I was delayed an hour and just made my connection. I cannot understand how this airline believes a few free cookies and water will be compensation for all the turmoil they cause passengers. I would never recommend them. Even if I paid double, I would prefer to fly their competitors which seem to have better on time performance."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Toronto. Porter cannot manage even minor weather delays without spiralling out of control. Delays from minor interruptions get exacerbated with each successive flight. A brief ground stop due to lightning (let's say one hour for example) throws them so far off their game that cascading delays occur and translate into 3 and 4 hours delays of later flights and ultimately result in complete cancellations, without compensation. Either their scheduling is too tight to deal with relatively minor hiccups or they have such low priority at US airports that they lose landing/takeoff spots with no ability to recover. Either way, the customer suffers, communication is terrible and recourse is nonexistent. I do not understand how they get away with labelling delays and cancellations as ""weather"" (ie. you are out of luck for compensation) only because the fiasco began with a minor weather event but was actually caused by Porter's own overloaded and badly managed business model. In July, only 34 percent of porter flights from Newark to Toronto departed on time. This is outrageous. Over 30 percent of these flights were excessively delayed. Fully 10 percent were cancelled entirely."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ottawa to Halifax. The flight was first delayed and then canceled. I tried to talk to the customer service and they said as the problem is from the weather, it's not their fault and all they can do is refund my tickets. They didn't help me with any compensation; taxi or hotel, even though it was late at night and I was visiting Ottawa at that point. They kept saying, it's not our fault, its the weather. In conclusion, avoid it."
"Boston to Toronto. My original flight for Friday was cancelled, and they rebooked me in on Saturday afternoon for 4:55pm. No attempt was made to cover the extra night of accommodation that I had to pay for. The new flight that I was on was delayed several times until 6:20pm, then the flight was delayed while we were on the runway before takeoff, then delayed again when we arrived in Toronto before we disembarked. It was constant frustration after frustration with Porter - they sent a voucher for $50.00 that expired the day of, and I didn't see it until the next day anyway! Called to speak about remediation for the multiple delays and cancellation, was put on hold for a full hour, and then the response was slightly less than helpful - they told me to email them and wait for a response that could take up to 15 business days. I will never fly Porter again, not even if they paid me to do it!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a flight from Toronto to Chicago round trip. In both routes, there was a significant delay. Porter airport in downtown Toronto felt like a WWI shelter. I received an email that the flight is rescheduled after the actual time of departure was passed. And this scenario was repeated 4 times, a result of a 4-hour delay--although it was a beautiful summer day. The way back from Chicago to Toronto, the flight was also delayed, this time with no email notification. Not a reliable airline."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Halifax via Ottawa. The cancellation of my flight turned a weekend trip to explore a new province meet up with a friend I hadn't seen for 14 years, and fishing on the ocean for the first time into spending 8.5 hours on the phone. Their representatives tell me that while they are very sorry but they were only able to put a note saying to give refund when requested. At first it looked like $1300 loss of the weekend I was able to get down to 40% at this current time via 10 hours on the phone in total. I really feel that the raccoon should be a weasel at this point for their mascot. Nothing against weasels but the way they will hide behind legal disclosures can only be described as such."
"✅ Trip Verified | Newark to Toronto. This airline knows how to frustrate travellers. Flight was originally supposed to leave at 410pm, 6 different time changes later it’s 630pm and there is yet another delay. There are no clouds in the sky and the sun is shining as I write this review. The best part is that my original flight was yesterday at 4pm. As I talk to other passengers, I find out that some were supposed to fly out today we’re bumped to earlier flights today. Thank you Porter for making sure you ruin flyers who were supposed to leave yesterday by letting others scheduled to fly 24 hours after you ahead of them. Speaking to your staff on site, not one of them cared or tried to do anything differently. So much for enjoying the long weekend with our families, there were 7 of my coworkers that were put off by this. Now I get to sit and not arrive home until tomorrow - 48 hours after my original flight (we had to pay for our flights today too!)"
"✅ Trip Verified | Toronto to Quebec City. Ridiculous! Flight is delayed because they overbooked it. They're offering 400$ to take the next flight which is 2 days later. In downtown Toronto it barely covers a night in a hotel, not to mention food costs, etc. And they're threatened to cut people based ""on priority"". Never taking Porter again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Quebec City to Toronto. Delaying the flight 1 hour and 45 minutes while adding 30 minute delays every 25 minutes. Porter offered no apologies or accommodation. Then after landing, they held us in the airplane for 25 minutes. This was the first and the last time I'll be using Porter."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Washington to Toronto. My flight was delayed by 3 hours going to Washington and again 3+ hours on the way back. Both times the communication was not existent and the customer service the worst I've experienced. They lied every 30min and what they told didn't match the delay emails we would receive. Even the flight attendants from Washington to Toronto couldn't crack a smile which could have gone a long way considering the terrible experiences and lies we had just endured. Upon arriving to Toronto already at risk of missing my connection. That flight was delayed as well. I explained my risk and not one person attempting to help or call to say I'm coming. Nothing! I then was searched not once, not twice but 4 times, before I could run to my gate just in time to have the gate attendant shut the door. All I received from there were excuses and blame on me, instead of an apology on behalf of the company. Completed disappointed and will not take this airline again."
"✅ Trip Verified | Mont-Tremblant to Toronto flight was due on Feb 20, Porter re-booked me to Feb 26 - six days later. Reason was bad weather. No compensation, no hotel, no alternatives. As a couple, we both needed to get back to town for work, so we booked at taxi for $250 and drove from the ski resort of Mt Tremblant to big Canadian hub city of Montreal, stayed in an airport hotel ($200), and flew out the next morning. We got to our work locations a few hours late. Subsequently, I contacted the Manager, Customer Relations, Porter Airlines, who said ""The rescheduling of your flight six days later was based on seating availability and make a claim with your insurance or credit card provider."" Basically - tough luck. We spent $4000 on this ski - hotel - flight package, and had to scramble and arrange for ourselves a taxi, new flight, hotel in the dead of cold winter night in remote French speaking Quebec resort town - lovely customer relations Porter!"
"✅ Trip Verified | Porter Airlines New York to Toronto flight cancelled. Stated due to weather while radar shows no rain or high winds. No comp offered for extra hotel or taxis. Next flight was too late next day to catch Monday meeting. The icing on the bad service cake is that they damaged my luggage and their solution is for me to leave or at the airport for repairs then spend more money to go pick it up once fixed. No concept of accepting responsibility for what used to be a pretty good airline."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boston to Toronto. We recently flew with this airline for a short commuter flight (approx. 1 hr 40 mins). Our flight was delayed 40 minutes, but with little explanation as to the delay. Our pilots did endeavour to make up time in the air. The design of the plane is such that, depending on the seat, passengers may experience louder in cabin noise (than had been my experience with other airlines). In-service was fairly standard, but did include free alcoholic beverages - I believe there was one white and red wine selection, respectively, and one brand of beer. On arrival, we were met with damaged luggage - one hardshell suitcase had been cracked and punctured, and one softshell suitcase arrived scraped, dirty, and weathered. We submitted a claim for the hardshell suitcase and were directed to also follow-up by phone. As the damage was extensive, we declined the airline's offer to attempt to fix the suitcase, but decided to accept the reimbursement for the bag (a standard amount) that would have at least partially paid for the replacement of the bag. After leaving the counter, we awaited the free shuttle advertised as a perk of flying with this airline. However, after waiting 15 - 20 mins, we learned that the shuttle was not running that evening and that we would need to find another mode of transport into the city. When we did arrive home, we did follow-up with the airline but were only able to leave a voicemail, re: compensation for our baggage. After not receiving a return call within 2 weeks, we found another phone number for the airline and connected directly with a kind agent who apologized for our baggage difficulties and for the missed contact. She also informed us that, unfortunately, unlike what had been described at the baggage counter, this airline's policy would not allow issue of a voucher to cover the replacement of the exact style of bag that was damaged (part of a set), but only offered a replacement bag that the airline deemed as equivalent, or a travel voucher with the airline. We did learn that, because the planes are smaller, bags are stacked (more so than, I imagine, with a larger carrier) and potentially resulting in the damages we experienced and reported. We are now paying out of pocket to replace our luggage. After this first experience with the airline and for what was to be a relatively short flight, I cannot recommend this airline. Even if this was a unique experience, the response of the airline still leaves us without recourse and paying more out of pocket to replace our bag than was the cost of our flight. It is not worth the expense of flying with this carrier when other major carriers fly this route, and without these challenges."
"Not Verified |  Wife and I wanted to go to Toronto and Porter was the least expensive, but we read many of the reviews and were worried, they weren't that good. Well our trip to Toronto and back were excellent! No troubles at check-in, non at the airport, none on boarding. Flight was smooth. Would certainly fly Porter again. No doubts"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ottawa to Halifax and return. Before booking our flights to Halifax for a weekend getaway, we had also looked at other airlines. Our choice then fell on Porter Airlines because it offered better prices and better travel times compared to the competition. Both flights departed on time, and the seats were comfortable and had decent legroom. Porter only uses Bombardier Q400 turboprops, which are efficient and reliable airplanes. Snacks and drinks were offered, and were good enough on both flights. Overall, both plane rides went very smoothly, and I remained positively impressed by Porter. Highly recommended."
"Not Verified |  Since I was travelling to Montreal, I had to stop in Toronto to change planes coming and going. On each leg of the trip the plane was delayed, minimum of 30 minutes. The snacks and drink options were more than acceptable and the staff consistently polite. No explanation for delays, other than the convenient weather excuse."
"Not Verified |  Toronto to Boston. Frequent flyer with this airline here. When it's good it's fantastic, when it's bad it's a disaster. The Good: The higher tiers of VIP status are very useful. Free front seats, free luggage, free flight changes, priority re-accommodation, line bypass at security (although this has not been consistent lately). Free change to earlier flights on certain routes. The city center airport is great for anyone living downtown or traveling to business meetings downtown. The wait at customs is never long. Security usually not bad. Luggage to carousel time at city center airport is crazy fast. Free snacks in the lounge and free drinks/snacks/alcohol in flight. Flight attendants are usually pretty nice. Even before I had VIP status, they would occasionally accommodate a change or request where any other airline definitely would not have. The noise doesn't bother me as I am used to it at this point, but if you are used to jet planes then you will find these planes noisy. The BAD: Flights are fairly regularly significantly delayed, mostly during the winter months. Flights get cancelled more often than other airlines as the planes are tiny, so is the airport/runway, and the weather by the water is not always cooperative (fog!). 2. Communication to customers regarding delays is almost non-existent. You can track your incoming plane on a variety of apps and know the outgoing flight will be delayed by a ton, but Porter rarely reports the delay until 15-30 minutes before the original scheduled departure - at which point most people are already in the lounge waiting.  City center airport's US departures and arrivals side is mixed with the Thunder Bay/Sudbury routes for some strange reason. The result is long waits at the gate once the plane arrives, just sitting around doing nothing and stuck on the plane because a Canadian flight is offloading/boarding and the US arrivals can't mix with the domestic. I have waited up to an hour to get off the plane in the past because of this problem. One of the absolute most frustrating thing about Porter. 4. Unpredictable line bypass - this has been worst in the last 6 months. Those of us with VIP rely on our security line bypass, often arriving 30 mins before a flight with carry on only. It seems to be unreliable lately on the US side with the line often closed."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Newark delayed departure of 45 minutes on 28th May. Absolutely terrible airline. They literally cannot take their planes off on time. Once your flight is canceled be prepared to wait 4+ hours to talk to a customer service agent in order to have to privilege of getting your money back. I booked a Porter pass with 10 flights, 6 of my flights were canceled and 4 went off late."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Montreal to Toronto. First time with Porter and I was pleased with the service. The check-in desk had a small issue with my passport details but this was sorted out with no complaints. Boarding was very quick as my flight has only 20 passengers. Departure from Montreal was on time. The seats were really comfortable and crew were friendly. Inflight service was a beer and a bag of chips, which was generous for a really short flight. Arrival into Toronto was on time and as I did not have any checked luggage I was at the terminal exit in just under one minute. It's great they have a free shuttle bus service to Union Station - that saves passengers a bit of money. Will be happy to fly with Porter again in future."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boston to Toronto. It was my first time flying with Porter, and will be the last. Both ways, my flights were delayed by hours at a moment’s notice (was told at the gate). I  should’ve paid a little more and flown with a more reputable airline; Porter was a waste of money, and more importantly, my time."
"❌ Not Verified |  Halifax to Windsor. Extremely disappointed with Porter. They delayed my flight five hours to supposedly get a part for the plane. How this was not known until after we should have boarded is beyond me. They handled it poorly, basically you're out of luck and have to wait. All other flights are booked as well so I have no options, and will be missing a day of work now."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Newark. Worst airline I have flown with. They constantly cancel flights at a moments notice due to various issues such as ‘crew staffing problems’ at a moments notice. They then don’t answer the phone and I have been on hold for 3 hours before hanging up. Very slow to refund cancelled flights. Very expensive to rebook with a different airline at a moments notice. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Sudbury. 3 round trip flights with Porter over a one month period. 2 return flights cancelled, Porter can't fulfill it's part of the agreement. I recommend avoiding Porter unless you have lots of time to be wasted on hold and stuck at airports waiting for Porter to delay your ""rescheduled"" flight. I will no longer be subject to Porters terrible customer service."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I sit and wait on the phone for about an hour and a half to receive a refund and no one bothers to pick up. I understand there was an ice storm and that the airline was not able to fly us  (Sunday April 15th - Toronto to Montreal). But if you keep canceling and rescheduling flights for two days later, giving a credit does not seem appropriate. I would like to get a refund. I had to take the train to make it to Montreal, at my cost, and I do not wish to have a credit with Porter and run the risk of this happening again during my next booking. If only customer service offered a person to listen and help at the end of an hour and a half wait, I would not have written this review. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boston to Toronto. I had broken my foot while in Boston and needed to get home so I could get casted in hopes to avoid surgery. There was a storm in Toronto (obviously not Porters fault,) so the my cancelled our flight and rescheduled us on another flight three days later! After 5 hours on hold to book an earlier flight I was told there was nothing they could do and that they couldn’t give me any feedback whether or not to go wait at the airport. When we got to the airport my husband and I were booked on different return flights that day- which was fantastic. But I was appalled when I got on my flight (first one out so I could go to emergency) and saw 2 free seats on the plane. We were missing work, spending $300 a night on hotels, I was in severe pain and unable to walk- and Porter offered no support while having open seats on a flight. I’ve had negative experiences with Porter before but this cinched it- I will never fly Porter again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Quebec to Washington D.C. Beware: 30 minutes before boarding your flight it could get cancelled. Then they can't put you on a different flight until 4  days later because they are such a small airline and have no partners. What's worse is that no one can get you a refund, even after you've waited an hour and 37 minutes on the support line. When asked about a direct extension to call into (because they said they couldn't refund you since you didn't book directly with them) they have none. When asked about an email to use, they said they only have an ""online form"" which, if you read it, is for ""Compliments, suggestions and complaints"". Absolutely amazing. My point is, yes, this was a very unique experience, but as an airline based in Canada where the weather is often snowy and knowing their planes are smaller than the normal commercial crafts, you would think they would hire more people to give you support at the very least? When to fly with Porter: If you have all the $$ and spare days in world and don't mind just having your entire travel plans twisted at their pleasure. When not to fly with Porter: If you are a normal person and would rather not spend twice the amount to return home. Their actual flight experience is average. Nothing different form a major airline. They entice you with free drinks/snacks, but its your average things. Nothing worth spending time stressed out about making it home, booking last minute travels, and spending 12 hours on the road."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Toronto City. You'd think being right downtown would save you some time, it won't. This airline seriously lacks organization, as my last 5 flights have been delayed by 2 hours or more. Finally have learned my lesson and will never fly with these guys again. Pay the extra money, head to Pearson."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Toronto. I received an email that our original flight time from Newark to Toronto was cancelled and rescheduled but when we went to check in, the woman asked us if we wanted to take an earlier flight out. Frustrated with the cancellation we gladly agreed, only to go through security, check our bags, sit on the actual plane, to be told to get off the plane as only I had been moved to the earlier flight while my friend was not. After getting our carry on back, we were lectured by the airline attendant that this was our miscommunication. Due to this, my friend and I doubted that our luggage would be placed back on our original plane and not lost. I do not recommend this airline what so ever."
"✅ Trip Verified | 
Due to fly Porter Airlines from Newark to Toronto City. This airline is so unorganized. My friend and I were told we were moved to an earlier flight, got checked through the gate only to be told by the flight attendant that only one of us was moved to the earlier flight. I was rudely told to leave the plane, and after asking for an explanation I was confronted by one of the Porter Airline employees who continued to tell me the whole thing was my misunderstanding and mistake. Now we are waiting on our original flight and had to make sure our luggage wasn’t being sent on the earlier flight without us. Not a good experience at all."
"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Toronto to Chicago. I want to like Porter because having a flight from the downtown island airport seems so convenient. But they just can't get it together. I've never had an on time flight, and this is the third Porter flight that has been cancelled outright. It was also canceled at a time when there is no option but to take a much later flight."
"✅ Trip Verified | Newark to Toronto City. I'm not sure why this airline bothers with flight times. They should just tell you to show up sometime within a few hours of your flight. I have flown with them numerous times and they have never been delayed less than an hour, and up to 5 hours, or cancelled and rebooked. It's ridiculous. What good is a good price if you can't count on arriving any time close to the scheduled time?"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Thunder Bay to Timmins via Toronto. Today I had the great pleasure to fly for the first time on efficient and friendly Porter Airlines . It is primarily a Canadian Regional based out of Toronto. I am presently a Delta (Skyteam) Diamond and United/Lufthansa (1K). I was 100% satisfied and will be flying Porter whenever I get a chance. I had a choice to fly Air Canada, and could have accumulated more Star Alliance miles/points and chose this little giant killer. Congratulations and thanks for the safe and professional flights. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Booked to fly St. John's to Toronto. Delayed 6 hours before cancelling. Delayed on rebooked flight, over an hour sitting in plane waiting for paper work. After initial delay because flight crew wasn't here. Porter refused to give anyone hotel vouchers or dinner vouchers. Some people have missed multiple connecting flights. No communication from Porter."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Washington. Speaking to customer service agents was the opposite of helpful. I was told by three agents regarding a delayed flight:  “The aircraft is unsafe to fly today.” - “They are fixing your aircraft” - “There is bad weather” - “Your flight hasn’t arrived because of mechanical issues at its origin” - “It is too cold to fly right now”  The agents at the service desk were rude, short and had no knowledge of anything happening. Every 10 minutes I received a delay update and each time I inquired why, there was a new and unrelated excuse. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Boston. I will never fly with this company again. We were supposed to be leaving at 5:15 pm and didn't leave until 9 pm. When we arrived in Toronto to get our connecting flight we were promised we would be able to make, but we missed it because we were ""taken off the flight"". Everyone told us different information and no one was sympathetic."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Halifax. The 4th time flying with them in a row where the flight is 1-3 hours late. This time we missed our family dinner (it’s sunny and clean in both places). When you write them they never answer back and staff at their desk get mad at you when you ask politely why it’s late. It used to be great I don’t know what happened. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto City to Quebec City. My experience with Porter Airlines was exceptional. The trip out of City Airport was easy, convenient and fast. The Porter check in staff were courteous, efficient and answered my questions. The waiting lounge Porter uses was quiet and comfortable. Our flight left sharp on time and onboard service was impeccable. Overall it felt like flying the old fashion, elegant civilized way."
"✅ Trip Verified | Definitely last time I fly with Porter! My flight to Ottawa was late by 1-hour. Then flying back to Toronto they cancelled my flight (almost an hour before). I had to pry information out of the service agents. They weren't very helpful. But I was lucky enough to get on standby and make it home the same day I was meant to fly out."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Porter Airlines delayed my return flight from Toronto to Timmins on November 9, and it was a disaster ultimately diverting to Hamilton (which they failed to tell everyone until boarded and door was locked so we were trapped and not headed to our destination). Beware, they do this on late flights I've come to learn. The flight did not post a delay but did not board and no announcement was made prior to the scheduled departure time of 5:45pm. At 5:52pm I received an e-mail notification of a delay to 6:15pm. Shortly after that, the ground staff announced the delay and said it was a short delay “due to scheduled maintenance” (which made no sense as I assume you do all scheduled maintenance at your hub in Toronto or the GTA). At 6:03pm I again received an e-mail notification of a delay to 9:20pm. There were no updates provided every 30 minutes per their ”Delayed, Diverted and Cancelled Flights” policy. At 7:43pm I again received an e-mail notification of a delay to 9:35pm. There was no further information provided in respect of what was happening during all of this, which we later found out Porter was flying up another plane and the one we were supposed to fly on had been taken out of service). At 8:25pm I  received an e-mail notification of a delay to 9:45pm. This made it 4 hours, which according to their ”Delayed, Diverted and Cancelled Flights” policy meant passengers should be provided with a meal voucher – This did not  happen. At 9:52pm I again received an e-mail notification of a delay to 10:00pm, at 10:23pm I again received an e-mail notification of a delay to 10:20pm. Eventually, the flight boards and there was no warning about what was to occur next. Once everyone was on board and the plane door closed the Captain came over the PA system and said that we would not be going to Toronto but rather to Hamilton, Ontario (over an hour away by car) – there was no other detail provided. I asked the Flight Attendant what this meant and she said that we would fly into Hamilton and then a shuttle bus would take us to the Royal York hotel (not to the Island Airport to be able to get my car – which you could not get off the island given the delay). Several passengers demanded to get off the plane – this meant a further delay, by now it was approximately 10:30pm. I asked if I could fly out the next day and was told I could, so I decided to get off the plane. When I got to the counter inside the terminal at Timmins the agent said that the morning flight had been cancelled, again another fact not shared prior to my decision to disembark. They also told me the midday flight around noon was full on November 10th and I could not get on that flight, leaving the only option the 5:45pm flight the next day. I was told Porter would not provide a hotel in the circumstances but I could make a claim, which I did and they denied to pay anything other than $8.00 for a meal. I had meetings in Toronto on November 10th so I had to fly out in the morning, that left my only option to purchase a one-way ticket with Air Canada on a 5:20am flight (cost $392.42 CAD), plus meant additional expense to transit from Pearson Int’l back to the Island to retrieve my vehicle."
"✅ Verified Review |  Super delayed flight from Sault Ste. Marie to Toronto. Captain couldn’t speak clearly with blurred English. I feel very unsure about why I chose Porter Airlines. So many others on this flight missed connections to other flights due to waiting times. I would definitely choose another airline in the future."
"✅ Verified Review |  I will never fly Porter again. I thought I would try their airline because they fly into Bishop in Toronto rather than Pearson, which is closer to downtown. Their fares were also a little cheaper than Westjet and Air Canada. However, it turned out to not be worth it whatsoever. My original flight was delayed for hours, then finally after continuous delays, they cancelled it altogether because Billy Bishop does not allow planes to land late in the night. They rebooked me for a flight the next day, which I couldn’t take because I would have missed the event I was flying for in the first place. I requested a full refund, and they said they would process it, and over 14 weeks later I have not gotten any money from Porter. I have called them multiple times, and each time the wait is over 30 minutes on hold to be told that my refund is processing. The next time I had to fly to Toronto, I took Westjet. Even though one of my Westjet flights was cancelled, they gave me a place to stay for the night and provided transit to the hotel. Porter absolutely refuses to reimburse you for any travel costs, even though I went back and forth from Newark with no flight. Do yourself a favor and book with a more reliable airline, especially if you have something important to do."
"✅ Verified Review |  
Return flight from Washington Dulles - Toronto City Airport. I was a bit worried about flying on Porter after reading all the negative reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. Almost everything worked well, flights left on time, inflight service was good and seating was good considering I am a large guy. The only drawback was that on the return leg, the waiting lounge in Toronto City Airport was busy making seating a bit of a problem. Also, the ground service for wheelchairs on arrival into YTZ was a bit haphazard and poorly organised with staff palming off their responsibilities to each other. There was free coffee and snacks in their lounge and on the aircraft. In fact, they were serving wine and beer for a one hour flight. Based on my experience, it was a quick and painless experience."
"✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to Montreal. Any flight can be late but Porter still posting on time departure 45 minutes before flight leaving more than 75 minutes late. ""Wait in lounge"" long after late posted departure time. Little information from staff - ""waiting for crew but guessing when they might arrive"". Dirty and old plane."
"✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to Chicago. The fact we didn't board on time didnt bother me. I'm a bit overweight mostly in the belly area but never had a problem on a plane. I'm not obese and the FA made a huge scene asking loudly if my seatbelt was on. It did fit, it was obvious since it was buckled on, felt she did it unnecessarily. Even the man in front of me apologized on her behalf."
"✅ Verified Review | Four flights in total and all of them delayed. Disorganized staff, rude, and inattentive. Just ridiculous to always be delayed. I never write reviews but this is ridiculously frustrating. Two hours delayed from Toronto to Ottawa, and we're still sitting on the Tarmac. I'll never recommend or fly with Porter again."
"✅ Verified Review |  Ottawa to Moncton. Between my flight being cancelled, lack of communication, long holds on the phone, being unable to assist in helping me due to what problens they caused. I am beside myself with the terrible service they provide."
"✅ Verified Review |  I will never fly with Porter Airlines again, first and last flight from Fredericton to Ottawa. The adviser was very rude, in addition, they charged an extra $43 for a checked-in bag over 9 kg. We were also late boarding, I fly all over North America and am generally critical of other airlines too, but Porter is by far the worst. I scored both Air Canada and Westjet a 2 and 3 respectively, Porter scores a 1."
"✅ Verified Review |  Will never fly Porter Airlines again. Leaving out of Washington DC my flight was delayed 3.5 hours, causing me to miss the connecting flight in Toronto. The only other flight to Quebec already being full I had to catch a flight out the next day. Porter did give me a hotel voucher for the night. The hotel being 30 minutes away I was told that the cab fares and meals would be reimbursed once I mailed in a form along with receipts. That never happened. Didn't hear back from them. After trying a second time and again being ignored I'm willing to take the loss on the cab fares but will never fly with this airline again. Our return flight was also delayed. Luckily we didn't have to go through customs in Toronto or we would also have missed our connecting flight to DC."
"✅ Verified Review | I used to be their biggest fan and recommend them to everyone I knew from friends to clients. I live and work in New York and am from Toronto so I go back several times a year to visit family. Usually I can only come for a weekend or so, which makes these constant and awful delays a complete nightmare. What's the point of even going for a weekend if I lose 50% of my time to Porter's delays. Yes, I love the outfits, cabin crew service, the cute Owl, the free coffee and snacks but none of the above matters when the flights are constantly delayed. As I write this I am stuck on the tarmac at Newark trying to deplane after a seriously delayed flight from Toronto. My Sunday is completely ruined and I have so many weekends similar to this spent wasted with Porter. I'd be better off driving the 10 hours at this rate! Don't be bothered with them. Great when they first started but pretty terrible today. Basically like a lot of superficial stuff layered on top of poor basic airline service aka - getting to your destination on time. Thanks for nothing Porter!"
"✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to Chicago. I have never experienced bad customer service like I did with Porter. The first time my boyfriend and I booked a flight with Porter our flight was cancelled due to bad weather. It was almost 11 PM so we were informed that we should go home and we will be contacted by someone in ""20-30 minutes"" to get details about our alternate flight - we went home trusting the airline to keep their word. This call never came. We kept trying to reach the call centre but they shut at 11 PM! We ended up paying a huge fare to finally fly with Air Canada as Porter never got back to us. Since then we have contacted Porter through the web form, call centre and even at the airport desk - this happened 2 months back and our complaint has still not been handled. I work in the travel industry and am not a fan of North American airlines but this was a new low. I would not recommend this airline at all - I'd rather pay a little extra to fly with someone more reliable as eventually we ended up paying a 1000$ extra for a last minute ticket with another airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  I went to the airport and while in security I received an email from porter that my flight from Toronto to Windsor had been cancelled. That would be the second half of my flight, there was not to be a rescheduled flight until 5:00pm that night. I was unable to make any arrangements at that time as I had to board. Ultimately when I arrived in Toronto to speak with the staff I was told that it would be too bad for me, and that there was a staffing issue so I was stuck in Toronto. I could rent a car or take a train and be reimbursed later. I took the train. The next day I watched my phone like a hawk for any trouble regarding the returning flight for my daughter and myself. I was disgusted when I was informed at 10:26am that my 1:30pm flight was cancelled. yet again because of staffing issues! I was told that there was nothing they would do for me, and that I could just try to find my own way again and ask later for reimbursement. I took another train at my own expense to Toronto to make it home. I did not get home with my daughter until after midnight because of this, My entire weekend was spent on a train and a phone on hold with Porter, I was screwed around by Porter and the staffing issues that were clearly at the forefront of the issue, these flights were booked months ago and were cancelled with no time for alternate arrangements to be made. I called for many many hours on Aug 12 and 13th as did my boyfriend, we both sat on hold for over 3 hours several different times as there is no one taking any of the calls for customer service. In the course of 48 hours I had 2 cancelled flights, Seven delays."
"✅ Verified Review |  My most recent flight was from Timmins to Toronto, scheduled to depart at 3:45 pm on August 20th. Before departing for the airport, I checked the status of the flight and noticed that the morning flight from Toronto to Timmins had been cancelled. This happened to me the week prior. No reason is given for the flight cancellation, but it appears that if the flight is not fully booked it will be cancelled, usually within hours of scheduled departure.  Unfortunately this appears to be a routine practice for Porter. Upon checking my scheduled flight, there was no delay indicated. The flight was scheduled to depart at 3:45. At 3:47, I received an email indicating the flight would be delayed and would not depart until 4:17 pm. I was at the airport and checked in when I received this email. A 32 minute delay is minimal, but the actual departure was not until 5:50 pm. As is usual, there was a distinct lack of communication from Porter staff. I have been given a $100 voucher from Porter, due to the previously mentioned flight cancellation. The voucher must be used towards another Porter flight. I will not use the voucher, nor will I fly with Porter airlines again. The resulting inconvenience caused by delayed and regularly cancelled flights does not make the discount fares any more palatable. Porter are inconsistent and unreliable."
"✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to Ottawa. Delays and cancellations. This airline used to be very good when it first started out. On-time and reasonably priced. There is not a single time I have flown with them over the last three months if the plane has left on time, and during the last 2 flights, including today, the flight was cancelled and I was put on another flight - first 2 hours later, and today, 10 hours later. This is for a flight that lasts 50 minutes in the air. Porter has almost on the hour flights to Ottawa, but they put me on a flight that is 10 hours away and ruined my plans. In addition, the call centre takes on average 40 minutes to talk to someone, all the while hearing ""your call is important to us"". The seats are shabby and frayed, aircraft is dirty, airport staff are sullen. The only good thing is that their snacks are good - hardly a reason to fly with them. "
"✅ Verified Review |  Porter is the worst airline I have ever flown with and will never travel with them again. My flight was cancelled and rescheduled for the next day. My rebooked connection was delayed three times. Ultimately, I arrived at my destination 24 hours late. The worst part was the customer service.  Gate agents would tell us one thing and the people in line behind us another. Employees had no training and did not know what to do to accommodate customers. My original flight was two months ago and I have had zero response from customer service and no follow through on the vouchers that were promised to us at the gate. I need a simple piece of paper that state that the flight was indeed cancelled, and the reason, so that I can submit it to my travel insurance. Customer service cannot even be bothered to send this documentation. So I am about to lose out on my insurance coverage because their customer service just doesn't exist."
"✅ Verified Review | Do not use Porter Airlines. The flight itself was fine. Pretty smooth for the type of planes. My flight was delayed since the day before. It was delayed 2 additional times while waiting at Toronto and still did not leave in a timely manner and there as no weather or otherwise justifiable issue. Customer service on the phone was terrible even when I spoke to a supervisor. Save yourself! Don't do it! I read poor reviews and still gave it a chance."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flight cancelled 4 hours prior, without any reason given. Weather is sunny and clear both in Toronto and Timmins. Online check in requests cell number to reach passengers for important messages. Text message re: cancelled flight not received - never sent. Upon questioning customer service at Porter (on hold for 63 minutes), Porter does not use text messaging for important information, only email! Always check your email, never assume that Porter will text you critical information, such as flight cancellations. According to customer service: we communicate by email. My call to customer service ended in being disconected by a supervisor after repeatedly questioning why the flight was cancelled. Bottom line, don't rely on Porter airlines for reliable scheduled flights, and if you do, check your email, not your texts to see if the flight has been cancelled for no apparent reason. Air Canada is my next scheduled flight."
"✅ Verified Review |  My flight from Sudbury to Toronto today was cancelled with 1 hours notice. I picked a mid day flight expecting that I would be re-booked on the later flight if there was a problem. Well as I feared my flight was canceled, but I was automatically re-booked on a flight tomorrow instead of later today. I have a hotel reservation in Toronto tonight and an early appointment. I can't get through on the phone to Porter. Been on hold for hours and disconnected once already. Avoid this terrible airline that can't even answer their phones."
"✅ Verified Review |  Montreal to Windsor via Toronto. Extremely long delays both from Windsor to Montreal on July 29th and from Montreal to Windsor on August 12th. We chose to fly as opposed to driving to Montreal to be fresh and full of energy during a scout camp. However, on July 29th, instead of landing in Montreal at 4pm, we landed after 8pm, and didn't get to our camp until 10pm, at which time it was too late to set up our camping area and we had to sleep on the ground under the sky. On a way back, our flight was delayed again 4 hours. All in all, over 8 hours spent at the airport, hungry, with nothing to do.  And we paid a lot of money to travel comfortably - ironically, friends who decided to drive got to the camp and back to Windsor ahead of us. Please avoid this airline at all cost. Terrible service and no respect for passengers! They should be giving us a refund!"
"✅ Verified Review |  Sudbury to Chicago via Toronto. Booked a weekend trip to Chicago - outbound flight cancelled Friday evening due to weather. Flew out the next morning, but ended up stuck in Toronto for over 7 hours waiting for a connection to Chicago (would have been faster to just drive there!!). Almost every flight that day was significantly delayed and it seemed like half were cancelled for no apparent reason. We arrived in Chicago 24 hours after the scheduled arrival, which essentially cut our vacation time in half. It seems that random cancellations and extensive delays at Billy Bishop are pretty much guaranteed when you fly with this airline. Avoid at all costs, not worth whatever discount you think you are getting."
"✅ Verified Review |  Halifax to Toronto. I started flying Porter Airlines this time last year, they were a perfect solution to the many trips I've taken to and from Canada. However, my last experiences have been nightmarish. My girlfriend and I started our trip at Billy Bishop Airport (YTZ) in Toronto, our flight was scheduled to leave at 5:45 on a Friday. We arrived at the airport around 4:00 to an extremely crowded check-in counter and mile long security line. The line was serving no function as customer service representatives were pulling people out of the line based on their flight number.  Not to mention, the flight updates were coming simultaneously with the scheduled times of departure. We waited about an hour in check in, where we gave up and brought our supposed checked luggage back to our apartment. At that time we found our flight was delayed further. Long story short this process delayed us around 5 hrs from the time we were supposed to fly until we found out part of the leg of our trip from Montreal to Halifax was cancelled around 11pm. We gave up and went home. We ended up rebooking with Westjet - and flying out the following night. Coming to the end of our trip. We were scheduled to fly again with Porter from Halifax - a stopover in Montreal - and to arrive to Toronto. Our flight was set to leave at 7:30 pm from Halifax, it was delayed before we got in. Then we boarded around 8 pm, then deplaned due to mechanical failures in the bathroom. This delay put us back another hour. At that point a porter representative explained to us that since we delayed our flight so long. Billy Bishop would be unable to accommodate us due to their curfew. So our options were Pearson or Hamilton. Which was just a bold face lie, when we got in the air they told us Pearson Crews were on strike and we were headed to Hamilton where a shuttle would bring us home. I'm usually not one to complain, but this airline has been totally oblivious to the basic needs of their customers. As we landed in Hamilton, an automated voice came over the intercom with a pre-recorded message. Then the stewardess pulled out a binder to read a standardized apology on behalf of the airline. Saying ""we're sorry, we have arranged a shuttle, there will be no refunds"" - ""we hope you have enjoyed flying porter"". At some point this company has to step up and face their problems head on, and take some responsibility for the service that they value providing."
"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to Toronto. On my arrival in Newark I was told the flight was cancelled due to rain in Toronto and they had rebooked me on another flight 2 days later - 2 days later? I say how's that possible? They said nothing could be done at counter that I needed to call. So I called and waited on the phone for 3 hrs to have someone pick up and hang up on me. Called again and waited 2 hrs to have to same thing happened to me. I called a 3rdtime and waited 2 hrs and still no answers by that time I gave up and went to bed. Worst customer service I've ever experienced"
"✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to Boston. Flight delayed at 30 minute intervals, no announcement on what has caused the delay. No indication of whether the flight will actually depart. The service levels are amongst the worst I have ever seen from an airline. This airline cannot be recommended simply due to the lack of communication and indifference to customers."
"✅ Verified Review |  Ottawa to Timmins via Toronto. Worst trip of my life. Cancelled the second leg of my trip after I already completed the first. Cancelled for no reason! It was a beautiful clear warm day. No apologies given. They just want you to wait until they can fill the plane. No compensation except except some food from the Porter cafeteria. Forced to sit in Toronto for seven hours. Seriously messed up my plans. On the return trip two days later my flight was cancelled again. How can they get away with this? I told them to refund the tickets, and hopped in a rental car and drove seven hours to get home. I will never fly Porter again. "
"✅ Verified Review |  I was flying from Halifax to Toronto on Monday morning. Just 15 minutes before the departure there was an announcement that the flight was delayed by one hour due to maintenance issues followed by another announcement 10 minutes later that the flight has been further delayed by 6 hours. I had a very important meeting which obviously I had to miss. The flight was also delayed by 2 hours three days earlier when I was travelling from Toronto to Halifax. I have hardly travelled with this airlines and in both my experiences, the flight was delayed at the last moment. It is better to go with other airlines if you can't afford the delays."
"✅ Verified Review |  I fly from Windsor to Ottawa regularly and have been totally disappointed with the service recently. It's getting worse. My ""direct"" flight from Windsor to Ottawa once again failed to happen we were deboarded in Toronto once again and expected to wait, no explanation. This is not good enough Porter. You need to get your act together or you will be losing another regular customer"
"✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to Sault Ste. Marie. I received an email saying my flight was cancelled and I was rebooked on the next available flight for the next day. The problem was it was not the next flight which would have been the same day. I needed to get home that same day and was forced to book on Air Canada at a last minute rate of 4 times the amount that I had paid for Porter's flight home. I filed a complaint and had to wait almost 4 weeks for a reply. They  basically told me too bad and that I should have taken out trip cancellation insurance. My advice is don't be fooled by Porter's sale prices. If you can afford delays or cancellations the go for it, if not then book another airline."
"✅ Verified Review |  Extremely poor service received today. Flight was delayed (it happens) and we asked to board an earlier flight and were told we would have to wait until boarding complete. There were three seats left and the gate agent took 2 people on the same original flight we were on in front of us. He turned to us and said they needed to go ahead of us. Never did they ask why we had to get back on time, just made the call on his own. First and last time for us. We waited beside the counter not knowing we weren't getting on. Same staff that had talked to us talking, we asked if there's was still room and were told the flight has left. Not even the courtesy to let us know. "
"✅ Verified Review |  The staff are good enough, but with small planes they are often delayed due to weather. On my flight Toronto to Newark I was delayed 6 hours on the way there. The flight was cancelled on the way back, and we had to come back the next day at 6.55am after waiting more than 6 hours at the airport. The novelty of the free lounge wears off pretty quickly if you have to be there for an extended period of time. Also, the time and money saved on the journey to Billy Bishop is not worth the risk of my flight being delayed. Another big disadvantage is that there is no US immigration/customs at Billy Bishop. That adds extra time to your trip because you have to do that in the US, which usually takes longer."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Timmins to Montreal via Toronto. I have traveled 4 times with Porter Airlines and 3 times out of these, my flight was delayed or canceled. I would defensively not recommend Porter if you're on a tight schedule or I would recommend leaving one day earlier especially if you're going for business. This is definitely my last time traveling with Porter. The only nice thing about Porter (Toronto) it lands on the Toronto Island, in a small airport."
"✅ Verified Review | Worst airline ever. I am using Porter for the first time to Ottawa from Toronto because of the good reviews. I got delayed twice for my first flight - 230pm to 530pm, then to 640pm. Got $12 reimbursement for lunch but that's it. I am only staying in Canada for 3 days and this made me wait in the airport for the whole day."
"✅ Verified Review | We were scheduled to fly from Washington to Toronto City on June 18 at 5:15pm. Porter cancelled the flight. No reason was announced publicly, but a Porter employee said that the crew did not show up. We were re-booked on a flight the following day at 7:35pm (more than 26 hours later). This flight was delayed significantly and eventually left after 10pm, which meant that it could not land at Toronto City airport (which has an 11pm curfew). So it landed at Hamilton, and Porter bused us to Toronto. We arrived at about 1:15am on June 20, more than 30 hours after our scheduled arrival time. The ""travel disruption"" was the worst I have experienced in 40 years of flying. Porter seemed to regard the cancellation as a routine event, although they were incompetent in handling it. They provided no information about the cancellation by email or text message, contrary to their claim that they will do so. No Porter agent was at the gate at the scheduled departure time of the cancelled flight. They also refused to book us on another airline, although seats were available. They were also very disorganized. Initially, they handed out vouchers for a Hyatt hotel near the Dulles airport, but the hotel refused to accept the vouchers, and people who went to it had to come back. Evidently the Porter employees didn't know the hotels with which Porter has a contract! They then collected those vouchers and eventually issued new ones for a hotel much further away, without a restaurant and not within walking distance of any restaurant or food store. During the flight that ultimately landed at Hamilton on June 19, the flight attendant claimed not to know where the plane would land. She announced that we would land at an airport other than Toronto, and gave out information for landings at Toronto Pearson and Hamilton; she issued only a very perfunctory apology for the re-routing and got angry when passengers complained. Overall, a very unpleasant experience."
"✅ Verified Review |  Halifax to Ottawa. Once a great airline, now just like the rest. We experienced issues with Porter amending seats (which we had paid for) without telling us, and then showing up to be found that we had been shoved to the back of the Aircraft on a window seat (don't like window seats). Funds were eventually reimbursed, but they changed our seats again for the flight home and would not let me have an aisle seat, because I had paid extra to bring a dog. The Call Centre that is customer ""support"", did nothing other than to worsen the experience by telling me that I had to go fill out a form if I was unhappy, as apposed to passing that frustration up through their chain. The service once a the airport was marginal, however, the flight crew were brilliant - the last hope for this airline to be successful as they continue to expand. I, however, will never be found on another Porter flight."
"✅ Verified Review |  A flight from Boston to Montreal should never require two days. I was supposed to fly from Boston to Montreal via Toronto (PD946/493) on June 30, 2017. However, my last leg from Toronto to Montreal was canceled. I would even say ""canceled in a mean way"" : the flight was already delayed, it was finally time to board, and then they provided an argument for cancelation citing some problems earlier this day. You can imagine the mood of about 75 passengers lining up to be handled and rerouted by only 3 people of Porter. Just do the calculation: let’s say 50 units of people times 10 minutes each divided by 3, that is a long waiting time when you are upset and tired. My turn finally came at around midnight. Airline staff were evidentially overwhelmed by the situation and not at all cooperative. First, they only wanted to reimburse the lost flight or book you on another flight two days later. These were the only two alternatives, nobody talked about taking charge of food, lodging or other expenses, which occur during such a situation. Fortunately, I had the luck to talk with our corporate travel agent during my waiting time, who consulted me not to accept any reimbursement and push for other alternatives. Furthermore, she informed me that Porter Airlines had empty seats on Saturday. Confronted with this statement of open seats the next day, my counterpart from Porter simply stated that they were for paying customers and not available to us. Also, they were unwilling to put me on another airline. So, I eventually accepted a flight on July 2, i.e. 2 days later, and they actually had to offer me to take charge of the hotel, which I had to look for myself. But, I was advised that all other expenses are on my account. Let’s make a long story short. Instead of getting to Montreal in some hours, I will hopefully arrive within 2 days. This all is quite upsetting, but what upsets me most is the uncooperative attitude of Porter’s staff. Personnel did not show any empathy or concern for their passengers in this situation, even worse, they did not even try to support or accommodate its passengers during this mishap. ="
"✅ Verified Review |  Ottawa to Toronto. Once you get on the plane Porter is an amazing airline. The problem however is actually making it onboard. Its not a question of if or even when you will have a cancelled flight but rather - how many times will your flight be cancelled. I have had 3 flights in the last 2 weeks cancelled for no reason. When you are booking they offer a lot of flight schedules with the intention of canceling the ones that don't sell out and moving people around. That doesn't work for people trying to schedule meetings and events. I really wanted to like Porter since their in flight service is amazing, however I will never book with Porter again due to the fact that its about a 50% chance that the flight will be cancelled or delayed for an extended period of time until they have a full plane."
"✅ Verified Review | Was booked on flight from Boston to Toronto Friday June 23rd 8:20. Flight cancelled, no explanation why. Rebooked but for June 26th 7:20 pm (3 days later). How is this ok? Our company travel agent helped rebook us on another flight for next day but cost much more plus cost of hotel. Porter Airlines should be doing better to rebook flights they cancelled much more timely and provide better service (good luck ever getting through to customer service)."
"✅ Verified Review | Flying with Porter is always a disappointment. I have being doing Ottawa-Toronto and back 2X per month for 2 years. At the begginning I tried multiple times to fly Porter and always had my flight either delayed or cancelled. Of course I gave up and now I am just using Air Canada or WestJet. But today I decided to try again (one year later) - and again delayed and cancelled flights. My impression is that they can never honor all flights they say they have available. My flight is again at least 1 hour delayed and I am going to miss my commitment. Porter, my last try with Porter."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Toronto to Ottawa. People have always raved about how great it is to fly with Porter. I did not have that experience. I'm a business traveler and normally travel Air Canada with no issue (have status on Air Canada). For this particular trip, I had a carry-on, personal item, and a blazer (in a single suit bag). Before security, a Porter agent runs up to me and tells me I cannot have a 'third piece' (my blazer). I tell her it's just a blazer (not even a full suit). She insists it's a ""safety issue"" and brings me over to the counter to force me to put the suit bag into my bag and wear my blazer or check something in. I realize by the rules it looks like a ""third piece"" but for all intensive purposes, it was my jacket in hand or a woman with a small clutch in hand. I'm not sure what shoving the suit bag into my carry on accomplished nor how it resolved the ""safety"" issue. The agent clearly had no common sense and went on to scold me to ""stop rolling my eyes"" when I couldn't fathom how putting my suit bag into my carry on fixed her ""safety issue"". I know people complain about Air Canada but I have never encountered this level of nitpicking in a weak attempt to try to get me to check in my luggage since I had ""three pieces"" or lack of common sense from staff. Emailed Porter to let them know how I was treated and all I got was a response saying they can do better and the agent could have handled the situation differently but no apology. Thanks Porter. I will be sticking with Air Canada. You have trained your staff so well that they don't even know how to use their brains anymore."
"✅ Verified Review | The ground facility at Toronto City airport are nothing short of being amazing. The proximity to downtown core, the ease of checking-in and of course the infamous Porter lounge where beverages / food are complimentary. In my opinion, this hands down beat any of the major carrier in terms of speed / efficiency. The downside is however - despite being a relatively new airline, the plane interior - especially the seating upholstery badly need a refresh. The beige color sofa starting to show its age and comfort was just okay to be honest. I think to truly capture the business market, it's not just free beverage onboard that is required, but also a decent cabin in keeping with the competition."
"✅ Verified Review |  Montreal to Chicago via Toronto. Porter Airlines may cancel your flight last minute. They have no regard for your connecting flight time, and they might even cancel the later connecting flight they bumped you onto in the first place. That happened today. It may be cheap and they offer free refreshments in their ""lounge,"" but this is not worth the disregard for your schedule. Additionally, they will try to make you pay to check your carry on if they think it is more than 9 kg. "
"✅ Verified Review |  The day after Winter Storm Stella hit New York, flew Newark to Toronto Island (Billy Bishop). Fast check-in, offered an earlier flight and security a breeze. Like the free lounge with snacks, drinks & wifi offered to all passengers. Flight comfortable and cabin bright. Free snacks and drinks offered (British Airways could take note!). Having read other reviews I was very pleasantly surprised and would not hastate to recommend them. Billy Bishop Airport is a delight to fly into, free shuttle to the centre of Toronto."
"✅ Verified Review |  Toronto Island to Montreal. A cancelled Porter flight due to mechanical issues even though it was a quiet Sunday morning with spare aircraft around and every passenger fitted onto the next flight easily. Disappointing customer Service. No apology. Won't be using Porter anytime soon. Despite a nice service on the flights, they are unreliable."
"✅ Verified Review |  Ottawa to Windsor. This was my first Porter flight. I appreciated the excellent onboard service; however, their baggage fees were less than to be desired. Without a credit card I was unable to check in on line where I would have been charged around $32.00 for one small bag. When I arrived at the airport I ended up being penalized and charged $42.38 (including tax) for that one bag - coming and going. I felt extremely taken advantage of given that other airlines charge $26.25 per bag either online or at the airport kiosk. The was my first and last Porter flight."
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Porter Airlines from Dulles to Montreal via Toronto. Beautiful clear sunny day but half the flights, including mine, are delayed by 1-2 hours. Service desk attitude gives impression that this is normal. No explanation or apologies for delays. This appears to be a consistent theme with the comments posted for this airline. Everything else is ok. Flights on my outbound legs were on time so it looks like it is hit or miss with Porter. Price is way below competitors so it is still value for money if you're on a relaxed travel schedule."
"✅ Verified Review | I have had the misfortune of flying on Porter Airlines from Boston to Toronto several times in the past two months. Every single flight from Boston I have taken on Porter has been delayed from one hour to four hours, and after the four hour delayed flight, the flight was cancelled. The gate agents never provide adequate explanation for delays. It is a bright sunny day, waiting for my cancelled flight's rescheduled flight and again we are delayed. I have flown on other airlines to Toronto and have never had an issue. If you need to be in Toronto for a commitment, do not count on this airline ever to be on time or not cancel your flight after you wait a total of six hours into the evening with incremental delay after delay. They only allowed rebooking automatically through the Toronto office, some passengers receiving rebooking 3 days later! Overall a horrible experience and terrible carrier."
"✅ Verified Review |  I flew from Billy Bishop (YTZ) to Ottawa (YOW) and back. Service was very good both ways. Although flight delayed on outbound flight. Service was very good with premium snacks and a beverage served on a glass, nice touch. Landings at both YOW and YTZ were harsh. The newish foot tunnel leading into YTZ eliminates the use of the ferry. However please note that with the five minute+ tunnel walk and waiting for Porter's free shuttle can add considerable time to your journey once you've deplaned. It's a real time saver if you live and/or work in downtown Toronto. As a resident of the Toronto burbs it's almost better off flying via Toronto's main airport - Pearson (YYZ). Or believe it or not using VIA Rail to Ottawa. As time saving isn't that significant. In my case 3.75 hours door to door on Porter as opposed to 5 on VIA."
"✅ Verified Review |  I liked the Porter idea but its gone rather downhill. My principal beef is with flight flexibility. Porter has no problem rescheduling you when they cancel their flights or they are late and we miss connections. Flights must be safe, aircraft fitness and weather rules must be followed, I get that. I think about half of my multi leg Porter flights work out as planned. Recent flight was delayed an hour and a half due to inbound problem at Toronto, arrived in Toronto late, the flight was on the ground, but closed. They would not hold it, schedules to keep you know, spot on next flight. Another time, meeting finished early, can I take an earlier flight? No, wait for my flight, it arrives late, as a result I miss my connection to Ottawa, instead of home an hour and a half early, its 2 hours late. It goes like that. In my view it costs them nothing to fly you in a vacant seat, earlier flight. And after the many times they've slipped my connections, maybe they owe me consideration. Prices are not great compared to Cape Air or Allegiant. Porter points are pathetic."
"✅ Verified Review |  Halifax to St. John's. First time flying Porter Airlines and I was very pleasantly surprised, my new favorite airline for short distance travelling. The staff and pilot were amazingly friendly, was a different atmosphere than the other airlines. Everyone was talking and laughing and having a great time. Smooth take off and landing, and lots of updates from the pilot. Departed on time. Free snacks drinks and wine. I was really impressed with Porter Airlines, I've avoided flying with them for so long thinking you get what you pay for, but I was wrong!!"
"✅ Verified Review |  Porter Airlines, like all other airlines, has a policy that if they are late due to poor weather, snow storm etc, then too bad. I was in Halifax in early December and left for the airport over 2.5 hours before the flight was to leave. Unfortunately the highway I was on was brought to a halt for 1.5 hrs due to snow and an accident - as a result I was stuck unable to move. I called the airline to see if I could get on the later flight given the travel problem. They simply informed me that I would have to pay $170 (more than what I had originally paid for the one way fare). I have used Porter for years but I will no longer utilize their service. "
"✅ Verified Review |  While I've been flying Air Canada for my work commute between Toronto and Montreal, due to price I started using Porter. I have to say, for a more competitive fare and very good schedules and superior service standards, I much prefer Porter Airlines. The staff are very friendly and happy to welcome you onboard and serve you. The in-flight food and drinks are superb for such a short flight - you actually get a glass for your drinks, and there are a variety of teas (flavours) to choose from. Plus, Porter provides much more generous carryon allowance, which is perfect for a short trip. The only down side, from flying around 30 times this year, was that a flight was cancelled due to weather, which meant I was stuck and had to find overnight accommodation. That was very frustrating, as it was all very last minute. I really would highly recommend flying Porter."
"Toronto to Ottawa. Porter Airlines started off very well, it was convenient on price and flying into downtown Toronto. However they have progressively gone downhill. Six out of ten flights (I used to fly fairly frequently with them) with significant delays of two hours or more - in good weather. Poor customer service in explaining the reasons for delays. If you look at their flight panels you are hard pressed to find flights that actually are on time or within 15 minutes of schedule. I would strongly recommend going with WestJet, while it will fly to Pearson it has similar prices."
"✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to Washington. We arrived in Washington and immigration took over an hour, as it tends too in US airports. We got to the carousel and there was no sign of our checked luggage. Eventually a cleaner told us he'd seen someone from Porter go off with two cases. We searched around but could find no Porter desk or even a representative. A helpful lady from United suggested we go through customs and then contact the Porter office, after she had asked by tannoy for a Porter representative to go to the carousel to no avail. Eventually we found the Porter desk, which was unmanned. A contact number was displayed and we spoke to someone in Toronto, who clearly didn't care. They were aware that two bags had been collected, but the agents had gone home!!! Both our cases had a mobile number on the label, but no effort was made to contact us and so it was off to our hotel with no luggage. This is a small airline with no back up provision and no sense of customer service. They have no help desk in arrivals and you're left wandering around the airport looking for help. The following day we rang their customer services in Toronto and were promised a call back - none ever came. They then admitted that they were unable to ring international numbers (they're an airline!) and so couldn't ring our UK mobile. Our hotel receptionist was incredibly helpful and eventually got confirmation that our cases would be sent by courier to our hotel. She told us lost cases were quite common, but the airlines normally delivered them in the early hours of the morning. She'd not heard of an airline closing up, going home for the night and abandoning their passengers. Our cases never arrived by the promised time and it was after several more expensive calls to Toronto that we were finally re-united with our bags. "
"Windsor to New York via Toronto. Don't be fooled by Porter's low prices, their baggage policy increases the actual price by 25%. I've never had to check a carry on bag with any other airline, their policy cost me an additional $40 on a $160 ticket. Also the baggage fee seemed discriminatory, some passengers were able to leave their carry on bags on a cart on the tarmac for no fee as they boarded the plane, the bags were returned to the cart on arrival. This is what I'm used to when flying regionally with Air Canada in the past. Also Porter was over 30 minutes late on the second flight. Overall I had a very poor first and likely last experience with Porter Airlines. They fly small regional jets so overhead room is limited."
"✅ Verified Review |  Montreal to Halifax on Sunday 6th November. Heard about problems with flights delayed but for the price figured I would give them a try. Confused gate employees, planes not available, and a 3hr delay. I'm still sitting here waiting in the airport.  I will wait a few years to see if the reviews start changing."
"Newark to Montreal via Toronto. I was thoroughly impressed with the most courteous service I have ever experienced on any airline. In particular, one stewardess went out of her way to assist me, since I am an older traveler and somewhat physically challenged. Another point worth mentioning: the rest areas, particularly in Toronto at Billy Bishop Airport, set a new standard for the industry. Kudos to you all!"
"Sault Ste Marie to Toronto via Montreal. Amazing service, flight on time, the cabin crew was professional and courteous. The snack and beverage was great. I don't drink alchool but they do offer a free cocktail. I forgot my iPad on the plane and Porter contacted me by phone and email to re-assure me that it was safe. I had not even noticed that I forgot it. The only thing missing was entertainment - but the flight was short. We will be flying Porter whenever we can."
"✅ Verified Review |  After a 90 min delay, Porter cancelled a mid-afternoon flight on a sunny day from St. John's to Ottawa. Staff were extremely unhelpful and told us to call customer service and left. Tried to call, was on hold for nearly 30 min and then disconnected. Left the secure area and went back to Porter desk where I was told no available flights to Ottawa for at least 3 days. They did not provide hotel either and told me their partner sites were full and to find my own hotel and would be reimbursed. They provided one $15 food voucher to be used in airport only - pathetic customer service. I'm currently out over $400 thanks to Porter. I bought a ticket on WestJet and flew me the following day. I have contacted Porter three times now (by email) and have yet to hear back - it's been over 10 days now. Will never fly with them again."
"On August 1st, 2016 my parents flew from Halifax to Toronto, on their way to Toronto for tests and assessments for my father to prepare for a double lung transplant. News of his diagnosis was shocking to our family as he was always healthy and a non-smoker. Even more overwelming was the fact that they would have to travel to Toronto for assessments and possible transplant. My parents haven't travelled much so as my brother and I watched them leave through security in Halifax we were naturally worried. My dad uses a wheelchair and portable oxygen tank; that would have to be adjusted on the plane to account for the altitude. All of those worries quickly dissipated when we received a text saying they had landed in Ottawa (stopover but staying on the same plane) and the flight crew was extremely helpful and compassionate. Upon arriving in Toronto they were met by Porter guest services and not only were they helped off the plane but a representative helped my parents gather their luggage and get them to a cab. Knowing that someone watched over them as they made this first trip was very nice for our family. I can't thank those people enough that their gesture really made this emotionally difficult trip just a bit easier. Thank you again. I will be telling friends about the experience they received yesterday and flying Porter myself. "
"Toronto to Ottawa with Porter - I fly frequently on this route and my running average is delays 75% of the time. The convenience factor does not exist anymore if you are wasting time waiting for a delayed flight most of the time. Moreover you have to pay extra to change flights if you want to get where you were going on time. Don't even bother talking to the service reps at Billy Bishop airport."
"Toronto City to Newark with Porter. This is the fourth time I have flown with Porter and it's probably going to be the last. So far every trip with them the flight has been delayed. How an airline flying short regional routes on a sunny day can have 45 minute flights delayed by over an hour is beyond me. The Toronto hub is convenient but if you have to sit there until your flight should have landed in New York then any convenience has lost its value. That and having to pay to check a relatively small bag  is a final nail in the coffin. "
"Toronto YTZ to Newark in May 2015. This is an airline that distinguished itself by its customer focus, but I believe things have changed recently. They have made terrible changes to their VIPorter program that essentially devalued points that were already earned. Their customer service dealing with a grievance is faceless and non responsive. They have made other changes as well to their unaccompanied minor policies that are frustrating. I used to be a huge fan, but no more. "
"There seems to be a common complaint of delays or cancellations with Porter Airlines, but I certainly didn't see that. Flew from Ottawa to Boston via Toronto Billy Bishop and then back, and on both trips I had zero complaints. No delays, arrived on-time or a couple of minutes early. Lounge was very comfortable, staff were friendly and helpful, and I couldn't really beat the price I got. 10/10, would fly again"
"Toronto to Thunder Bay with Porter Airlines. I caught the shuttle to Billy Bishop Airport. My flight was around 5:30 and had caught the shuttle with enough time (I thought) to make it to the airport and check in. The shuttle ran a little bit later than expected due to rush hour traffic so I was running a little late but still had time. As this was before the walk way was opened, I had to catch the ferry which was about to leave right as I arrived. Once I got to the other side where people check their bags I saw the large line and decided to do the express check in as I only had a carry on. The machine would not let me check in and gave me the ""see Porter assistant"" message. One happened to be walking by me to take her break and I asked her for help. She asked me what flight I was on and told me that it had began boarding and to go in the ""large baggage"" check line which had about 5 people in it. I did as I was told and when I finally got to the counter I explained my situation. The staff was unprofessional and had major attitude and told me that it was not fair to customers in the longer line that was wrapped around the velvet ropes beside us. I explained that my flight was about to leave and she continued with her attitude saying ""that's not my problem."" Working in customer service, I was astounded by her attitude. I had paid good money for this ticket and she did not care whatsoever that I was about to be stranded in the airport. At this point I was in tears. Luckily, her co worker yelled at her to check me in as my flight was about to leave. She rolled her eyes and said ""fine."" After she checked me in she said with attitude ""have a great day."" I was the last person to board my flight. I do not know what I did to make her have such an attitude with me as I would never act like that towards anyone. When I reported this to Porter Airlines, I waited two weeks for a response and only got a ""we're sorry, we will have her manager talk to her. See you next time."" Due to the convenient location of Billy Bishop Airport I will be flying with them again, but they seriously need to improve their customer service training and I would have appreciated more of a heart felt apology. I guess that was too much to ask."
"Hopeless customer service and no notifications of flight cancellations or delays, unless you go and ask them. They gave me a ticket from Montreal to Newark via Toronto (Billy Bishop). They instead send me to Hamilton (an airport 1 hour away from Toronto) and arranged a bus from there to drop me at Toronto at 1:30am in the night, only to realize that the Toronto airport is closed till 5am. Looks like this airport is closed everyday from 11 PM to 5 AM. I did not have anywhere to go and spent the night in the cold in cafes. Nowhere I have seen this kind of treatment by an airline. They don't have the minimum decency to warn me that the airport is closed."
"Flew Porter Airlines for the first time with my granddaughter from Toronto to Ottawa. We both were extremely impressed with the services, seats comfortable, no delays, snacks were fine, wine served in a glass was an added bonus. I have nothing but positive things to say. The lounge in Toronto was amazing with all the free goodies. I will be certainly flying Porter Airlines again."
"Toronto to New York with Porter Airlines. Great service, prompt timing and extremely practical. The staff are very helpful and the airport is easily accessbile from downtown Toronto."
"Trip going fine until arrival at US customs in Chicago Midway. Seems Porter has its own tiny customs area. Got stuck for 40 mins in long queue waiting with only 4 agents. Definitely put me off using this option. Chicago O'Hare airport next time."
"We missed our Porter Airlines flight, and we had to pay 300 CAD to get on another plane. This one then had a delay of 45 minutes.  So, if you are late, you have to pay. If Porter is late, nobody cares."
"Our first flight experience with Porter Airlines from Toronto to Chicago was a disaster. We were scheduled to fly from Toronto to Chicago to be at wedding celebrations later that evening. 20 minutes past the scheduled departure, our flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues (there were 3 flights cancelled that day due to mechanical problems), and the only option provided to us by rude ground crew was to take the first flight out the next day. They refused to put us on a wait list for the remaining flights for the rest of the day. Porter are not equipped to handle the slightest deviation from normal operation of their daily schedule. Ground crew give you the impression that Porter is doing its customers a favour by operating an airline, rather than the other way around. We finally managed to get waitlisted for remaining flights that day, and did get on the very last flight that night, having spent 10 hours at the airport. If you have to be somewhere at a particular time, don’t fly with Porter - you don’t know how bad they are until you have a problem! "
"I used to have one of those jobs that required a lot of travel, so it's not like I don't have anything else to compare this to. I don't like flying so I tend to avoid flights with connections. Porter Airlines would not be my first choice, since most of their routes require a connection, but I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of service and efficiency at Porter. I have flown Porter twice now and must say this airline really makes an effort to make flying a pleasant rather than an experience to get past with fingers crossed. The flights left on time, the business center, free quality snacks and beverages really helped to make the travel experience enjoyable. It's more than I can ask for and even expect - Porter Airlines is an airline that's a real gem. "
"Planned a vacation to Montreal for the weekend. While sitting in Porter lounge we were first told plane would be 15 mins late, then about half an hour later there was an announcement that the flight cancelled due to not enough crew. Told to wait seated until given instructions to come to counter. Got email that we would be on the 9 pm flight, we had booked a car in Montreal airport. "
"Porter cancels flights for no reason, and emailed me at the last minute notifying that the flight is cancelled. Booked two different flights within 3 months and both have been cancelled. They give a 50.00 voucher for your next flight but can't use it because the flight may be cancelled again. "
"I have flown twice with Porter since December. I found the website easy to use. In December, I found the prices reasonable as I booked very late after the death of my sister just before Christmas. Inflight snacks were tasty and different and my beverage was served in a glass. My family flew to Ottawa in early August. Security was very sensitive and polite as we traveled with an urn. Online booking was easy and I used both one way options and return with price very reasonable. Flights were smooth. Seat was comfortable. Adequate space as bag with urns easily fit under seat close by. Nice option to cabin check larger bag. Lounge in Toronto and Ottawa is very comfortable with free coffee, cookies and Internet. I wish Porter flew into more cities. I appreciated the service given by Porter."
"They cancelled our flight 1/2 an hour before it was due to take off and made us wait over 5 hours for the next flight. They wait listed us on the next available but those who made it on that flight were the ones who paid more for their tickets. They penalised us fir not booking early! Their customer service was terrible. This is an airline I will never fly with again."
"Never again! Small airline, waits for all connecting passengers when planes from elsewhere get delayed as if this was a bus or something. I've been late coming in and late 5 hours on my flight back. If this is what happens in summer, what's happening in winter? Unless you want to spend 5 hours in a nice lounge instead of flying you are better of flying from Pearson."
"I have usually been a big supporter of Porter but the last 24 hours have challenged my loyalty to the airline. My flight from Newark was cancelled bad weather happens nothing you can do about it. However the response to the situation is what infuriated me. After not making the stand-by list for the last flight out I asked for assistance in booking a hotel as I imagined they would have dealt with this situation previously. Not only were the staff unhelpful they were downright rude. Given the situation and not wanting to hunt down hotel rooms to sleep for only 6 hours I decided to bunk it in the Newark airport. In the morning while getting my ticket for the morning plane the service desk tried to charge me for another $26 bag fee even though I pre-paid from Toronto. After determining that I indeed had pre-paid the fee she put the bag through. After finally arriving to Toronto at 9.30am we were treated to a 45 minute delay with the baggage carousel. For 30 minutes my fellow passengers and I looked at each other dumbfounded as our luggage was at the top of the conveyor belt. Again these things happen but you would think an announcement of the maintenance issue would be a good idea by Porter. Eventually a woman with a walkie talkie was working with the maintenance team to get things going. While it would have been nice of her to provide an update to the customers about what was going on I am not going to moan after a certain point realizing the issue was going to take awhile she took off her high heels climbed the carousel and started to pass the luggage that had made it to the top of the conveyor belt. I live in Toronto and the company I work for is in New Jersey. I make frequent flights to the area and Porter used to be my default choice no questions asked. After this shameful debacle that is no longer the case. Get it together Porter!"
"Terrible I arrived at Toronto Island (Billy Bishop) at 7am after looking online to find the flight to Halifax delayed hoping to move it to the flight just after. Everything went fine then when boarding time came and went the excesses from Porter started first they had told us someone vomited on a seat on the planes approach and needed cleaning (the plane had been on the ground all night and should been cleaned) then they informed us the plane needed to be de-iced then they inform us that there is no first officer for the flight because he was at another airport. Lying to us the entire time I have no idea how people travel with Porter for business they are never on time and their staff is hit and miss by what I saw today also under staffed. Should also note that Air Canada sent three planes out while we waited. Porter is now a last resort sad because they used to be much better."
"Flew from Toronto to Newark over the Christmas Holidays. Booked the flight less than 2 weeks out for the cheapest price available at the time. Both flights took off on time with absolutely no hassle. I love the lounge at Billy Bishop Airport (Toronto) where you get complimentary (unlimited) cookies Starbucks coffee Tazo Tea water pop almonds newspapers and Wi-Fi. I was pleasantly surprised to see that at Newark Liberty Porter had a small corner reserved for their passengers with similar (yet slightly less impressive) complimentary amenities. Only downside was the outbound flight was seated next to the noisy engine."
"I have flown with Porter a couple of times and haven't had issues but after today I will definitely be looking into other options. I arrived at the Toronto island airport at 11.00 am today for a 12.35 pm flight to Chicago. The flight was already delayed about 20 minutes by the time I got to the lounge. At around 12.30 pm Porter staff started asking for volunteers to fly at a later time as weather conditions required a lighter load on the plane. People volunteered and the rest of us finally started boarding just after 1.00 pm. When I finally got on the plane the pilot announced that we would be waiting for passengers from a connecting flight. Then around 2.00 pm the flight attendant announced that a few people would have to leave the plane and book a later flight because the reduced visibility required an even lighter load. I was one of the people selected to leave the plane which was incredibly frustrating because I did not have any checked luggage (come on how much weight could I have possibly added to the plane) and booked my flight more than two months ago. The next flight available was two days later. I did get a voucher which I appreciate but what happened today was just unacceptable - probably the worst experience I've ever had with an airline. It has been common knowledge for days that a snow storm was approaching so I don't understand why Porter had to wait until I was buckled and seated in an aircraft before telling me I had to fly at another time. Just appalling. P.S. - It turns out that four Porter flights flying out of Toronto island airport had to be diverted this week. This airline is a disaster."
"Flight 0383 on Monday Dec 8 2014 the outbound was cancelled due to 'mechanical' reasons. Of course I was only notified of the cancellation when I was in a taxi half way to the airport. I paid $1450 for my flight to Chicago due to booking only 5 days in advance. In addition Porter charged me $26 each way for the one bag I checked. On the return flight 0392 on Dec 10 2014 my bag was 1 kilo (2.2 lbs) over the limit. I was told I could remove weight or pay an additional $75 excess bag fee. At the same time the passenger at check in next to me was advised that he should carry on the bag he was going to check because it was below the carry on weight. I removed some items from my bag and went back to check in. The check-in agent advised me that my bag was now 1 kilo under and would I like to put anything back in my bag. What a joke. Absolutely no common sense with respect to the check-in agent. The flight was half empty so weight and balance was not an issue. Flight left about 10 minutes late and after 20 minutes in the air the captain came on the PA system to advise that a latch had come loose on the cargo door and we would be required to return to Chicago. Another 'mechanical' issue I suppose. Flight eventually left one hour later so that we arrived about 2 hours late. So Porter wasted 4 hours of my valuable time yet wanted to charge me $75 for having 1 kilo excess baggage. I think the service was really unacceptable."
"Newark to Sudbury via Toronto. I really wish I could give Porter Airlines a better rating. They have nice planes great staff the lounges are wonderful but their reliability makes me hesitant to use them again. More's the pity because it could be the best airline in North America. The flight from Newark to Toronto was on time and the service was faultless. On arrival in Toronto all looked okay for the next leg to Sudbury but then that flight was cancelled because of maintenance issues. I was shifted to a later flight scheduled to depart four hours later but was delayed by a further two hours. Many other flights were also delayed. Credit goes to the cabin crew on this flight for maintaining a positive demeanour despite being faced with a very grumpy passenger load. Based on comments I heard on the aircraft and have read on here cancellations and long delays have become commonplace at Porter. I think this airline is perhaps growing too fast and its aircraft inventory is too small to cope with anything but one of those extremely rare days when nothing goes wrong. It really needs to focus more on reliability."
"I will never fly this airline again first and last time. Took a quick weekend trip to Montreal from Chicago. The outbound trip Saturday was fine the return trip on Sunday was a total disaster. Saturday's flights were nearly empty but the flights Sunday were packed so it seems that if there is a rush the airline has no idea how to handle it. There were no weather issues or anything to cause multiple delays on Sunday and I really was never given a clear answer as to why all of my flights were delayed. It was a mix of ""technical issues"" and ""delays at other airports"". I was leaving Montreal for Toronto then had a connecting flight to Chicago. When booking my tickets all I was offered was a 30 minute change over between flights for the flight home. Porter in Toronto has a small terminal so on a normal day this should be no problem. In the end I missed my connection in Toronto to Chicago because of the original delay of 45 minutes in Montreal and my new second flight (an hour and half after my original flight) was also delayed by an hour and a half. I was suppose to arrive home around 3:30pm and didn't until 7:30pm. Simply never ever again."
"Very disappointed in Porter these days. Last 2 trips - to Toronto and to Sudbury - were delayed and delayed. Spent most of the day in the airport in Thunder Bay and Toronto. A 4 hour trip turned into a 10 hour. No explanations no information. Today I realized I made a mistake in booking a flight from Thunder Bay to Toronto. Called as soon as I noticed - $75 charge to cancel the flight and to rebook would have been double the price. I used to fly Westjet all the time - I think I will be returning to Westjet. Not happy at all and a weekend in TO ruined."
"My flight from Toronto to a conference in Chicago was cancelled with no reason provided 12 hours prior to the flight. The only option Porter offered was to re-book 2 hours after the original departure time. If I had cancelled to rebook on a different airline (at a significantly increased cost given the short notice) I would have received only a flight credit not a full refund which is unbelievably bad customer treatment. I was forced to take the later flight and I missed the two sessions at the conference that were the primary reason for my attendance. I am 6 feet two hundred pounds. These planes do not accommodate above average sized people period."
"Just awful! Used to be really great and easy. Lately (the last year and a half) they have been so unreliable. We do monthly flights from Toronto to Montreal and vice versa and every time without fail are delayed one way if not both and/or cancelled. There have been 3 times this year where the flight has left for Toronto only to turn around and come back to Montreal for one reason or another with no compensation. A free drink is certainly not worth all of the trouble it is faster to drive with all of the delays. They really need to get things back on track can't imagine how poor their on time service rate must be at this point."
"I would not recommend Porter Airlines if you need to get someplace at a certain time and are depending on their schedule. Our experience was delays and more delays. First problem Porter changed our original flight time and we were not notified. We flew from Montreal to Toronto changed plans to fly to Boston with a connecting flight in Boston to Houston. We missed our connecting flight because of the changed schedule and then further delays. The flight leaving Montreal was approximately 1.5 hours late. Then our connection in Toronto was late as well. We originally were to arrive in Boston at 4.35pm but did not arrive until 5.50pm. Porter employees in both Montreal and Toronto were unwilling to help us find another alternative in order for us to arrive in Boston in time for our connection. Consequently we had to get a hotel and stay overnight."
"Our family really used to look forward flying with Porter but in the last two years you feel like you have a 50/50 chance of having a significant issue with your flight. Yesterday August 30/2014 Flight 635 from Toronto to Thunder Bay. They announce a boarding 10 minutes earlier than scheduled due to the ""air show"". Ok no problem. We get on the plane and sit and sit in the hot cabin. You repeatedly hear cargo doors being opened and shut. The pilot/co-pilot leaves the plane and has discussions with the ground crew and also I think went into the terminal as well. Eventually one of the flight crew tells us that due to ""technical issues"" we will be flying to Hamilton to get fuelled up. I guess it was either that or take passengers and baggage off the plane. We leave about 15 minutes later than scheduled for a short flight to Hamilton which takes about 15-20 minutes. We sit on the tarmac in a hot plane for about 20-25 minutes while getting fuelled up. Finally leave for Thunder Bay and arrive one hour late although with the all the waiting and heat in the plane while on the ground it felt like the journey took forever. This is not our family's first time with significant issues with Porter but it will be our last because we will not be flying with them again."
"My flight with Porter was cancelled due to engine problems and rescheduled for 7 hours later. All but 10 passengers were put on the 4.30pm flight I was one of the 10. I left the airport and returned when they told us to only to be told that the piece they were supposedly fixing the aircraft with had never even come and that our flight was rescheduled for 8.30am the next day 22 hours later that our original flight. My family went back and forth from the airport 3 times to drop me off and pick me up because they were not up front with us. As compensation I was told we will be getting at $100 dollar voucher which we probably already spend in gas and food. Not to mention time missed out friends during my yearly visit to the province."
"Flew from Toronto City airport to Washington Dulles on 11 Aug. Service on the ground was good although a little more attention could have been paid to wheelchair users. A general announcement was made re boarding but that was all but there were no staff around to assist my mother for boarding. I decided to push her wheelchair myself. On board the flight attendants were pleasant and we were served drinks and cookies. The flight was pleasant with great views of Toronto city on taking off. Seat comfort was good and leg space was incredible for a small aircraft. A great experience."
"Flew Ottawa-Halifax Return. Flight to Halifax on time return slightly delayed. Crews extremely friendly and efficient providing comfort to others during turbulence. Seat was leather wide enough and legroom more than good (I am 6 feet 155 lbs). Snacks provided were very good - their terra chips are unbeatable and I love their real glasses! My only gripe is the Ottawa lounge - there was free internet and drinks but the coffee machine was out of order and there was nothing to eat. I know Porter's Toronto lounge is better so I hope they improve Ottawa's!"
"On June 12 2014 Porter delayed my return flight 269 from Toronto to Ottawa for 45 minutes. No explanation from Porter staff in the Billy Bishop Airport lounge. Finally once on board the captain said the delay was because of refuelling problems in Montreal. While I was waiting for my delayed Ottawa flight Porter announced the cancellation of their flight from Washington. No explanation for that either. On June 24 2014 Porter delayed my return flight 267 from Toronto to Ottawa for 45 minutes. No explanation. Porter also announced their Toronto-Windsor flight was delayed. No explanation. Porter delayed my flight again for 45 minutes. No explanation. Then the plane arrived late and sat on the tarmac waiting for thunderstorms to clear. Thunderstorms cleared. There were no weather issues. Plane was not boarded. Then an announcement that because of a crew medical emergency flight 267 was cancelled. Porter has no crew backup no employees on standby even though Toronto is their headquarters their hub. Nor does Porter have any backup aircraft. When one is delayed or grounded their whole system collapses. Porter has expanded too quickly and are overextended on their routes. As such Porter is now demonstrably unreliable and a danger to the flying public."
"I have been reading the previous comments and the Toronto/Newark link appears to be a real problem. I was caught in the computer chaos on Sunday June 8 and was delayed for 6.5 hours half in Newark and half in Toronto. These are my issues. There was no concern for the passengers no vouchers for food no good information no basic consideration. There was a standby in Toronto which would have got me home 2 hours sooner but there were no procedures in place to ensure that those most affected were given priority. It was just the usual whoever shows up first gets the seat. Porter executives and staff did face a catastrophic incident but were clearly not prepared to handle it. They are just not experienced enough. This was my first flight with Porter and also my last!"
"It should not take more than 10 hours to get home from Newark. Experienced delayed departure of 4 hours due to a computer problem in Toronto. Apparently this is not the first time this sort of thing has happened. They were not helpful about getting the other members of our party home after they missed their connecting flights. My journey was terminating in Toronto. The shuttle bus people ought to have mentioned that TTC at Union Station was closed for construction but they did not. This added additional delay and expense to my journey."
"YUL-YTZ May 28. Arrived late from an international flight and made it to check-in as Porter was about to close the flight. I asked if I could be bumped to this flight as I have had a long day and arrived in from France and she said this would not be a problem! It was a full flight - only one seat left - and the check-in agent was most happy to get me home an hour early. Service onboard stellar as always and I will continue to fly them as often as possible. People who gripe about Porter need to understand that in terms of poor weather they have chosen to fly on turboprop aircraft and in and out of an island airport where even the slightest change in poor weather can result in major delays and is not the airline's fault."
"Toronto Island to Chicago Midway. Great airport and good free shuttle bus from/to Union Station downtown. Airport public areas similar to business lounge with free tea coffee soft drinks and snacks. Quick check in and boarding. Dash 8 400 with lots of foot room and leather seats. Very good inflight service box lunch and choice of free alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Surprisingly fast flight and landing in Midway. Quick US and polite customs with self-service kiosks for US and Canadian passengers. Baggage reclaim very fast. Good subway connection from Midway to Chicago loop but have correct change for ticket machines."
"Took the family to Vermont for a ski holiday. The flight to Burlington was great the airport in Toronto was great free drinks and wide aisles made the kids happy while we waited. So far so good. However the flight out of Burlington was terrible. We sat in Burlington airport and waited and waited. No announcements no one at the gate or the desk to ask. The schedule board still said ""on time"" an hour after the scheduled departure time. We sat and waited for over two hours after our scheduled departure and heard nothing until the flight attendants walked past and told us the plane would leave soon. Very poor communication. I don't mind a delay but the lack of communication shows contempt for their customers."
"My first time on Porter and I couldn't see what the hype was about. Flew one-way Sudbury-Toronto fare was excellent but the service was underwhelming. The interior of the planes is too clinical for my liking (just beige and grey) and the seats already looked worn. Check in was fine but flight attendants on this particular flight were not friendly at all no greeting at the door unsmiling for the whole journey and the service perfunctory. All the announcements were pre-recorded (aside from the captain) and the mood in the cabin was depressing. One of the flight attendants in particular looked just plain miserable for the whole journey. When we left the plane she just stared at the floor and repeated ""see ya"" to all the passengers - this did not feel like 4 star service. The only impressive thing was the drinks service lots of choice and everything free including wine and they use real glassware."
"Newark to Toronto. Flight scheduled to depart Newark at 4pm. Delayed 2.5 hours. After boarding we taxied on the runway for about 30 minutes with not much information communicated to the passengers. Just thank you for your patience. An hour later for a total of 1.5 hours sitting in the plane we were finally told that our flight had been canceled due to poor weather conditions at YTZ. After reading all of the other reviews here I'm wondering if delays and cancellations are just standard fare for this airline. To top it off the agents at the counter were not very helpful in getting us rescheduled. It almost seemed like we were bothering them. I chose Porter because they had the lowest fares. I guess you get what you pay for. Lesson learned. Never again Porter."
"The flight from Toronto to Myrtle Beach was quite satisfactory. The return flight was another story. Minutes from boarding there was an announcement to passengers saying that the plane was overweight and they had to make luggage a priority and golf clubs would likely be left behind. Fine. I could live with that. When we taxied to the runway we sat for an unusually long time then the Captain announced there was a discrepancy with the weight calculation and we had to return to the terminal to sort out the mistake. They took two trolley loads of baggage off and re-configured how they packed everything. Funny how they were re-loading golf clubs and not luggage! When all was said and done five pieces of people's luggage were left behind. I don't understand their logic in loading golf clubs when luggage was supposed to take priority. I don't understand how Porter can promote themselves as a golf destination airline and then not understand/plan that majority of people are going to travel with a piece of luggage and a golf bag. They should be pre-planning for 50lbs per person and make sure that requirement can be accommodated. I am certainly disappointed and will be telling everyone I know that if they are located close enough to drive to Billy Bishop to drive the extra distance and take a flight from Buffalo. A big ""thumbs down"" to Porter Airlines."
"Have flown Porter from Toronto to Newark 2 or 3 times a year for the past 5 years and without fail there is a delay or cancellation of the return flight. Last night - April 7 2014 was the worst. We were getting ready to board our flight when they suddenly announced there was unscheduled maintenance on the plane. Then they said there was a mechanical problem and they had to wait for another plane to come in. After finally boarding they announce we are 20th in line for take-off. Then the airport shuts down the runway for 20 minutes. By the time we take-off its after 10pm so no way we can land in TO before the 11pm curfew. We fly for about an hour thinking we are going to Toronto when they tell us we have to land in Ottawa. They blame all this on the weather. Put us up in a hotel 30 minutes from the airport. Porter fails miserably when it comes to having a back-up plan and communicating with their passengers. We have the right to know we were not going to Toronto and making our own decision about whether to stay on a flight which will have to be re-routed. Will never fly Porter again. They are inept at dealing with basic change management. And they want to expand - good luck with that."
"YTZ-YOW. This was the first time for me to use Porter and had very high expectation but I was very disappointed with the level of ground service and delays. Check in took over an hour then information centre at the lounge weren't interested in answering about my questions about the flight. The flight was delayed by an hour thus missing my meeting in Ottawa. It wasn't worth the money."
"Following two days of delays cancellations rebooking and repeated cancellations we had a Porter Agent split my young daughter's original reservation from Thunder Bay through Toronto to Ottawa and we arranged for a family member to pick her up at Billy Bishop Airport. After further delays she eventually left Thunder Bay on Porter flight 638 at 21.29 and was diverted to Hamilton during the last stages of landing just minutes before 23.00. The diversion is due to a curfew on landing and taking off from Toronto's Billy Bishop Airport. Our issue is that Porter Airline did not communicate to passengers that the flight would be diverted. Porter did not inform those waiting to pick up passengers at Billy Bishop Airport. Airport was closed at 23.00 and no staff were present. The family member sent to Billy Bishop Airport was left searching for our daughter. We eventually found that the flight was diverted to Hamilton and that our daughter took a shuttle bus to Union Station in downtown Toronto. Sometime after 02.00 am a local hotel was arranged where she stayed for a few short hours before making her way to the Billy Bishop Airport for her connecting flight. Our main concern is the lack of communication from Porter and the inability to contact anyone from Porter outside of regular business hours. Customers should beware of booking Porter through their hub at Billy Bishop Airport."
"Flew round trip from Toronto to Quebec City. First leg was excellent (on-time nice staff). Return flight cancelled due to severe weather which was understandable. However customer support for was nil; staff directed us to help line then vanished and no one was manning the phones (which cut out at 11pm). 3 days later and no response to voicemail or email. All we wanted was advice on whether to stick around for flights or try our luck with the train. Avoid them in the winter months or all together."
"January 3rd flight 142 from Newark to Toronto. Scheduled at 7.30pm delayed at 0.30 am and should arrive at Hamilton where buses will wait for us to get to Toronto! No accommodation will be provided. This is so usual with this airline avoid it."
"Halifax to Sault Ste. Marie Ontario: No bad weather conditions but delayed 1.5 hrs - was going to miss connecting flight so a very helpful employee got us on an earlier flight that went through Montreal and would get us there with 45 mins to spare. This flight also ended up being delayed but we got there with just enough time to run to the next flight. No issues although I didn't find the staff on board rude nor friendly. Bags arrived with no problems. Return flight - Sault Ste. Marie to Halifax: Half an hour late again. Flight was ok although no entertainment. We quickly got on the next flight and it was fine (Toronto to Ottawa). Then the last flight to Halifax was the most irritating noisy flight I've ever been on. We were stuck in a pocket of misbehaving children. I understand that kids will be kids but at some point a flight attendant should have asked the yelling to be toned down a bit."
"Dec 26th 2013. Nice sunny day. Posted a 35 minute delay for our flight to Washington USA. After an hour we ask them if we will make our connecting flight to Iceland then on to Manchester they say yes. After almost 90 minutes delay we phone the main line they say we will leave shortly and make our connecting flight. Pilot says he will try and make up some time he doesn't and as we land we still have to pick up our bags and re-clear USA customs. People let us ahead of them in line and we by pass picking up our bags and the Iceland flight had already left! Nobody around at Porter counter. We talk to Porter in Toronto the next day they say there are no flights to Iceland for another few days! We book United Airlines to Manchester. Never again."
"Dec 25th YTZ to YHZ. Return was Dec 31st YHZ to YTZ. Porter seems to be one of those airlines that people either love or hate. On the love side of the equation passengers get complimentary alcoholic beverages and box lunches that are tasty. Drinks are served in glass not plastic. On the hate side of the equation the airline can't seem to get organized when bad weather happens or when the plane fills up with too many leisure passengers all of whom tote 20 kg suitcases. Citing weight restrictions they remove those cases but tell nobody until they arrive at the destination. In today's environment it is tough to be a price leader as well as deliver excellent customer service at the same time. If they don't get the right balance soon they'll have more passengers leaving with bad impressions than favourable ones."
"23 Dec 2013 Toronto (YTZ) - Ottawa (YOW). Porter Airlines is one of the few airlines you can count on to be delayed every single time you fly them. It is completely unacceptable that they constantly make their customers late and offer nothing to make up for any such inconvenience. Even just while sitting in the lounge for several hours waiting for my flight as other airlines had no issues getting their flights off the ground on time Porter cancelled two flights and suggested that those customers fly with another airline (and pay the exorbitant fees they were charging at the gate) just to get home on time for Christmas. In fact I was just notified that my return leg of the flight I am reviewing has also just been delayed. Flyer beware."
"Absolutely horrible experience over the last three days trying to get our family friend back to New York. Sunday with almost no communication to passengers he sat waiting for 10 hours at Billy Bishop until flight was cancelled. Monday same thing - full day at airport scheduled flight cancelled. Today - they are on their third (3rd) plane and still haven't found one adequate to make the one hour trip to New York. I could have driven him back and forth to New York three times in the time we have been sitting here. inexcusable terrible service and we do not plan on ever using Porter again."
"I have been flying Porter for years and appreciate the friendly service nicely turned out cabin crew and the ""more human"" approach to air travel. Unfortunately we flew from Ottawa to Halifax yesterday in the midst of a storm. Our flight did manage to depart (late) although earlier flights had been cancelled. We arrived in YHZ and waited for our bags. Now sometimes baggage delivery is slow in Halifax so I was not worried initially. During this time another flight was called to queue up at the baggage desk (two service staff) hundreds of people but no announcements were made relative to our flight. After an hour I interrupted one of the agents and asked about the Ottawa baggage. She said it wasn't coming - yet there had been no announcement or no instructions. Upon arriving home I sent an email and called the call centre. The call centre was just rebooking passengers and gave me a number to call in the morning for baggage. It's been nearly 18 hours with no response from Porter. This is not acceptable. I really expected more from this company with it's focus on customer service. How hard would it be to email everyone on the flight or have had an agent come out and explain the situation? This is the fourth time my bags have been lost and by far this the worst experience I've had with missing luggage."
"I'm blind. I was flying from Toronto to Thunder Bay on Friday December 13. At first the CSRs came around to ask if I needed something every so often but then that stopped. Two to three hours of having no access to a washroom or anything they announce that the flights were cancelled due to a snow storm. I phone the Porter call center because I was stranded in the airport. Finally they agreed to accompany me to (and pay for) a taxi back home to Brantford for the night and return me the next day. I'd hate to know how much distress they've put upon other travelers with special needs! I'd give a rating of 0 but I'm giving 1 because at least they supported me in the end."
"Flight 274 YOW-YTZ return. June 14 2013. Best airline out there they make you feel human. Stress free check in. Plus I can drive right to the terminal. When tickets are bought on sale they make flying affordable. They should be given better opportunities to expand as long as it done with quieter jets. Great to use them to Florida."
"Took a Porter round trip with my wife and our three young boys but forgot our lunch bag containing some baby bottles on the initial flight. The crew found them looked up when our return flight was and when we reported into the airport for the return flight it was at the ticket counter waiting for us! (They even washed out the milk). Excellent service friendly smiles and great snacks/meals (for 2013 flying standards). They have our return business for sure."
"Toronto to Montreal # 411 25 Sep 2013. Montreal to Toronto # 414 27 Sep 2013. The best airline I have flown on. Flying out of Toronto is excellent the lounge is so nice free coffee water etc no long lines for security. The planes are so comfortable huge seats all like exit rows. I fly to Montreal for business once or twice a year always with Porter. If you fly at lunch you get a meal which is usually a chicken wrap with salad plus free drink like wine soda etc and this is a 55 minute flight. Never had any delays or problems can't recommend them enough. Rating 0 for inflight entertainment as they don't have any but no issue to me I use my iPad for everything anyway."
"Had a flight scheduled with Porter Airlines on Friday September 13th at 9.20 am from Boston to Toronto with connecting flight to Halifax Nova Scotia. The flight out of Boston was delayed for over an hour because the flight crew had not had enough time off between flights. This delay caused me to miss my connecting flight in Toronto to Halifax and they could not get me on another flight to Halifax for 2 1/2 hours later. So instead of arriving at 4.15 pm in Halifax I arrived at 6.45 pm and missed out on my 50th college reunion dinner. This was my first time flying Porter and now my last time."
"My first flight with Porter and I was satisfied. My only gripe was the check in agent was rude and made me shuffle 2kg to my hand luggage one of my major annoyances when flying really what was the difference if I am just going to put it in my hand luggage? It gives a negative first impression. Security check very fast lounge in Newark a nice added value perk with free Wifi legroom fine cabin clean attendants were great nice snack with wine in real glass! Landing on time immigration in city airport excellent. Overall the price was cheap and I am happy and would fly again."
"Attempting to fly out of Newark to Toronto we were told that we were held due to fog at Billy Bishop airport in Toronto. Odd thing was that was exactly what the people at Billy Bishop airport were being told were the ground stop conditions prevailing at Newark. So clearly neither condition was true. Delayed 5.5 hours in the airport with promises that the ground stop could be lifted soon and that we might be able to board shortly. We ultimately did and then spent 3 hours 40 minutes trapped on the plane on the runway. Told that the flight was cancelled. When we finally deplaned we were greeted by a line of approximately 200 passengers who had also had their flights cancelled with all of 2 customer service representatives handling the situation with a public address system that had stopped working relying instead on word of mouth trickling down through the line. There was no effort to either consolidate the lines or open another line to handle the 100+ passengers who had just deplaned leaving it to people in the competing lines to fight it out between themselves. I had to intervene to prevent a screaming match from turning to blows. There were people on my flight who had been trying to get a flight out of Newark via Porter for two solid days and failed. Customer service was AWOL and information not given in a timely manner which would have allowed passengers to reschedule their plans hours earlier. Never again."
"IAD-YTZ-IAD 9/11-12 2013. Why this airline gets the ratings it does is a mystery to me. Completely ordinary aircraft cabins and seats not terribly competitive pricing a thoroughly subpar waiting/services area in its hub airport (I've seen better at US Air and United) and nothing whatsoever to distinguish itself from the crowd in any other respect other than the fact that its staff seems nicer than that of most of its counterpart US airlines. Bottom line - I would neither recommend nor not recommend this airline."
"Toronto Island airport to Newark NJ. The flight was delayed for more than an hour but the announcements made were sketchy and no firm answer. Also the restroom was dirty and the lounge was messy and fridges were empty coffee machine (one don't work and the other has no beans and no milk). When someone ask to have it look after the csr at the desk just ignored him. I took Porter because of conveniences but I heard from others that their service level and reliability has been slipping since the early years of the airlines. Now I heard they want to expand it will even make things worse."
"Newark to Toronto r/t - Porter Airlines should rename its cabin to Comfort Class as economy does not describe the experience. For a North American carrier to provide a meal for an hour flight is noteworthy but for it to be free is nostalgic. I am a vegetarian and on returning the chicken wrap to the cabin crew they gave me an extra salad and came round with a couple of mini chocolate bars and extra nuts - most thoughtful and then apologized with a smile. On time convenient and Canadian hospitality - plus complimentary access to a lounge with hot/cold beverages delicious short bread cookies and WIFI. Billy Bishop City airport can put you in the heart of Toronto's financial district in under 30 mins from landing. No fuss in terms of gate checking luggage and we felt like the airline and its representatives cared."
"Flew from Toronto to Sudbury on August 32013. The flight left on time. I found the staff very courteous and helpful. They served a meal and drinks. Everything was very acceptable. I love Porter and would fly again with this airline."
"Toronto - Boston return June 28 — July 1 2013. PD 941 — PD 946. A lot of folks are impressed with the time savings of flying an airline from the Island. Here's my experience when arriving from the US. We arrived a half hour late due to weather — not Porter's fault. However Billy Bishop Airport should have been named Mickey Mouse airport. When the plane arrived at the gate people anxiously got up to leave. After a few minutes the plane's door opened and people started getting off. Then those people were sent back into the plane. It turns out that a domestic flight was loading and it's against rules for international arriving passengers and domestic passengers to mingle in the same zone. Why there is only one zone I don't know. People on our plane had to wait until the other plane was loaded. Then at Canadian Customs and Immigration there are two officers for passengers and one other who looks after airline staff first before helping with regular folks. Since another US flight had got in just ahead of us it took about 40 minutes to get through. However I was surprised to see people who had been much closer to the front of the Customs line still on the Island waiting in another line for the ferry to take us back to the mainland. I find that Porter uses its seat sale promotions as a classic bait and switch. I was enticed by the low fares advertised but could not find those fares on any flight that was convenient. In the meantime I'll pay the extra limo fare to go to Pearson and fly Air Canada which everyone loves to hate but which over many decades has proved to be extraordinarily reliable."
"I recently flew from Montreal to Halifax. Nice cabin interior with leather seats and pleasant service. Will fly with them again."
